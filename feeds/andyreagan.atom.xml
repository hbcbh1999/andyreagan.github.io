&lt;p&gt;This all went just fine for me, (remember to update your MacPorts first,
and do an upgrade) until it came time to compile OpenFOAM again. I kept
getting lots of "could not open file globalMeshData.H" stuff, and went
back to see what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that whatever happened, although having GCC 4.5, my machine
still used GCC 4.2 when I type "gcc."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much headaching, I was able to scrap together a working solution
by using MacPorts' select, and updating my hash. These two pages helped
me with each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
port select --list gcc&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;br&gt;
[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;

would think they're in their offices in the basement, the library, or
the coffee shop. But you'd be wrong, grad students spend their time at
the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know where that is, you can imagine Mouse hacking the
matrix, and probably stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we spend so much time there, here a few scripts that can make
your life better. Perl comes with MAC OSX, so these guys should run
right away on OSX, or any unix machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making aliases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you type something a lot (or just more than once), it can help to
make a shortcut (alias) for that.  This perl scripts makes them for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="perl"]&lt;br&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if (\$#ARGV != 1){&lt;br&gt;
print "bad arguments, need at least 2\n";&lt;br&gt;
exit;&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`echo \"alias \$ARGV[0]=\\\"\$ARGV[1]\\\"\" &gt;&gt;
\~/.bash_profile`;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;print "made alias for \$ARGV[0]\n";&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this to work, we're going to use it to make it's own alias!!
Download it and put in it /Users/yourusername/bin, make it executable
with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
chmod +x \~/bin/makealias&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now run it, to make itself an alias. First, this will look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
\~/bin/makealias makealias \~/bin/makealias&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is a little bit weird. Now make any alias you want (in a new
shell) with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
makealias foo bar&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or more usefully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
makealias mroe more&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which will execute more whenever you type mroe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cleaning up files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you download files, or *shudder* edited them on a
windows computer, there are Command-M characters at the end of each
line. Put this little guy (thanks to &lt;a href="http://schmeits.wordpress.com/" title="Davy Schmeits"&gt;Davy
Schmeits&lt;/a&gt;) in your bin
directory and make it an alias&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="perl"]&lt;br&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if (\$#ARGV != 1){&lt;br&gt;
print "bad arguments, need at least 2\n";&lt;br&gt;
exit;&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`cat \$ARGV[0] | col -b \$ARGV[1]`;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;print "thank me later\n"&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the last line if you're so inclined. To make this run, all we
need to do now is use makealias:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
chmod +x \~/bin/dos2unix; makealias dos2unix \~/bin/dos2unix&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bit of wisdom thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/"&gt;Peter Dodds&lt;/a&gt;.
Back up the tex and pdf of your work using this script. The default is
the local directory, and you can pass it any directory to back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="perl"]&lt;br&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(\$day,\$month,\$year) = (localtime)[3,4,5];&lt;br&gt;
\$year = \$year + 1900;&lt;br&gt;
\$month = \$month+1;&lt;br&gt;
if (\$month \&amp;lt; 10) {&lt;br&gt;
\$month = "0\$month";&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;
if (\$day \&amp;lt; 10) {&lt;br&gt;
\$day = "0\$day";&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if (\$#ARGV == 0){&lt;br&gt;
`cd \$ARGV[0]\; mkdir archive/\$year-\$month-\$day\; cp -v *.pdf
*.tex *.bib archive/\$year-\$month-\$day/`;&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;

`mkdir archive/\$year-\$month-\$day\; cp -v *.pdf *.tex *.bib

&lt;p&gt;And then for each machine you want to ssh into (do this on your local

cat \~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@machine "mkdir \~/.ssh; cat &gt;&gt;
\~/.ssh/authorized_keys"&lt;br&gt;
[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above may complain that the directory already existed, but it will
work regardless. On some machines there is a built-in "copy-ssh-id" but
I like the above because you can see what it's doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it, you're done. Things to note: only "ssh-keygen" once on a
machine, and you can run the second command as many times as you like
(to connect your local computer to lots of servers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final bit of good-ness: if don't even want to type out "ssh
user@machine" every time, try this on for size (this would make the
command "MACHINE" ssh onto user@machine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[code language="bash"]&lt;br&gt;
echo "alias MACHINE=\"ssh user@machine\"" &gt;&gt; \~/.bash_profile&lt;br&gt;

took a long Thanksgiving break to visit her and explore some of what
South America has to offer. It was an amazing trip, and I hope you enjoy
reading about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting to Vina del Mar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting places is half the battle, if not all the battle, of traveling.
And then there is getting places on a college budget, which involves
taking long bus rides, and transit across NYC. It was an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megabus to NYC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I slept in, so I had about 1o minutes to walk to catch the
megabus. It was close to my house, so I wasn't worried. I arrived
outside the Auditorium on UVM Campus where I'd seen the megabus before,
with 2 minutes until and left...and no sight of anyone or a bus.
Scrambling for my ticket, I found that bus was supposed to leave from
the Davis Center, a 5 minute walk up the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took off running. This is where being fit is important to
travelling (if you're an absent minded grad student). I saw a lady
walked down the hill and asked "Megabus?" and she says in an spanish
accent "Oh honey Megabus go that way" pointing torwards route 89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full sprint. Cresting the hill, I spotted the bus, and the driver
closing the baggage door for departure. As soon as my feet hit the bus
floor, it was moving. PHEW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit Across NYC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The megabus conveniently drops off in middle of NYC, and I had to get to
LGA airport. Its 8 miles away on the other side of the city. If NYC has
bike rentals, that would've been ideal. Instead I went for the
smartphone Google Maps, and was sent through the subway and onto the
bus. With no fewer than two people assisting this lost country boy (one
telling me I was on the wrong side of the subway for my train, and the
other paying my bus fare as I had cash and card...but no change, is the
1800!?), I survived the big city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Atlanta, and Santiago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane was rather uneventful, which is always good. Except for
leaving my books at a burrito joint in ATL, and running off of the plane
to go get them...all good. Had to get that last states burrito in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bus to Vina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part where Sam steps in, and handles all of the transportation,
in Spanish. Easy breezy, for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vina del Mar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beach, AirBNB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed in a room in an apartment right on the beach, that I booked
through airbnb.com. It was perfect, and our host was perhaps the nicest
person I've ever met. She just sent Sam and I an email wishing us a
merry Christmas! Breakfast was amazing, and did I mention that we were
literally on the beach?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it was warm. Good thing I remember to bring the trusty jorts,
which were just gathering dust in frigid Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandboarding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandboarding? Yeah. It's as cool as it sounds. I'll put a video here if
I get a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Valparaiso&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valpo is a very cool harbor town, with tons of character. Sam was an
excellent tour guide, and we explored the tiny back alleys of hillside
neighborhoods that were held together by elmer's glue and brightly
painted corrugated metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting to Puerto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bused back to Santiago, and then took planes. Well, one plane, but it
made a few stops and we had to get off once. At which point none of the
attendants seemed to know which plane we should get back on, but it was
the same one. So I was very concerned that since they didn't know where
to send Sam and I, there was little hope for our luggage. Somehow, it
made it to Puerto Natales with us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To the Parque&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the night in Puerto Natales, which is an awesome little
touristy mountain resort town. We got drawn into the brewery like good
American tourists, and had a great, albeit very American dinner.
Wandering around we found some food, rented gear, and got a cool little
hostel for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a bus out to the park at 7am, and the ride there was very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The W&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hiked it. Check out our promo video: (really, watch this)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t.co/gzQO9mn5"&gt;http://bit.ly/R9P5RX &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Puerto Natales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning from the hike, we had a great time in town, and ate
about 5 dinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to Santiago&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew. It worked out. Lots of plane meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Santiago&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel Sam booked online was very cool, and the bellavista district
of Santiago was super hip and incredibly fun. I'm not enough of a night
life person for it, but it was definitely going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;annnd HOME&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, I'm a flying extraordinaire, and fluent in Spanish. So this was
no problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>CHILE Pix</title><link href="/2012/12/01/chile/"

Sam after three months apart and hike some of the true wilderness of
Patagonia. All the t's are dotted for the details, including a window
seat on the Delta flight into South America and an awesome place to stay
in Vina through airbnb.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semester has been a boatload of work, mostly from my Advanced
Engineering Dynamics course. Sounds fancy, but it's really just applied
PDE's, or even more simply a whole lot of separation of variables. Safe
to say I feel comfortable confronting any PDE that is separable by now,
and have gone the extra miles with the homework by deriving the
solutions from the original PDE, and making nice visuals in Python with
Numpy and Matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also taking a measure theory course, I can't remember the fancy
name, and it's dry but still a bit interesting. Building an abstract
measure isn't too crazy, it's just really detailed with lots of entities
like semi-algebras and sigma-algebras and borel sets. Perhaps the most
exciting part so far has been proving the big integration theorems,
namely the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem. Heck it just sounds
cool. And now we're working with L-p spaces, which are big boy sets of
functions that I've glossed over the details of at conference
presentations. This course is hopefully preparing me to take the written
ph.d qualifier in real analysis, which I probably won't take for awhile
so I'm going to have to make a real concious effort to keep this stuff
fresh in my brain for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final class is turbulence with Yves Dubief, which I'm taking because
of the vague connection to research that I will hopefully be starting
soon on the UQ of ablative flows. So far it's been a crash course in
fluid dynamics, and I'm trying to keep up with the variables most of the
time (nu is viscosity, right?). Our final project for the class is going
to be designing a method to control turbulence in flows, perhaps by
making the fluid react to kinematic stresses by increasing viscocity
(that'll help kill turbulence, for sure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the thick of it, I've been spending a little bit of time
thinking about some other things that are academically oriented, and
soon I'll be linking up to a blog post about some of the network stuff
that I've been thinking about out, and spent some time trying to write
it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame 1.0 has been on hold since the end of the summer, where I brazed
the front triangle together in one day, after spending countless hours
thinking, designing and mitering. I've been derailed by two things
really, (1) school and (2) complication of the build. School hasn't
allowed me too much time (try doing research on top of a 60 hour
academic week and tell me about it), not to mention a bit of triathlon
and having some awesome visits from my buddy Dan Z and my Dad this past
weekend, which were great. Then the build itself: I've got the front
triangle together, and ran out of brass. Well yesterday I got more brass
in, and I'm not happy with the quality of the brazes on the front
triangle so I'll need to practice with this new stuff. There's no
question about it: to get better at anything takes time. If I could
braze one joint a day, monitoring my progress and carefully recording
the process that I use each time (amt/type of flux, type of flame and
heat, specific techniques) then I could nail some pretty brazes, but I
haven't managed to fire up the torch once since the summer, to be
brutally honest. I haven't even gotten to the complication of the build
itself: now I'm at attaching the chain stays to the bottom bracket, and
there are three degree of freedom that I have to deal with here. If I
was using a lugged BB, this would be soooo much easier. I really tried
to go the math and figure out how to best place the stays in the ground
plane, but even that isn't easy at all, and I haven't considered the
crank yet. Designing and building a frame is far beyond a trivial
matter, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I'll add some photos from the phone in here, I'm thinking of
one of a very rusty frame right above here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the past month, the brewhouse is up and fully running again, and
I'm drinking my own porter right now. I've got two kits waiting to be
brewed (figured I should just wait till after break), one sitting in
secondary that I'm very excited about as well. Building contraptions for
brewing, and being able to drink the fruit of the labor is really just
sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to work on the motorcycle a bit, but didn't follow through
with the repair all the way. The tank was leaking a little bit, not a
concerning amount, and so I decided to sand the paint off and fill it in
with some JB Weld. It got complicated when I'd been sanding and gone
through sometime like a half inch of powder. And I got worried about
what I was going to find if I went all the way to the tank. I should
grab the battery off the bike for the trip. And perhaps look up
winterizing it. The car is dead for a couple months, and I'll need to
get that looked at for going home for winter break. Haven't driven the
thing in three months, I really only need it for the trip home. Maybe
Sam will come get me. I should stop paying insurance on the car if that
is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much rambling... going to finish up a few more loose ends before
heading out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be updating with lots of pictures hopefully, I've got both GoPro
batteries charged up and my camera battery charged up!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Brewing by pictures</title><link href="/2012/11/11/brewing-by-pictures/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-11T00:01:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-11-11T00:01:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-11-11:/2012/11/11/brewing-by-pictures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Moving my maple jalapeno ipa to secondary, where here I soaked and

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I settled on the &lt;a href="http://www.raleighusa.com/archive/2012-steel-road/furley-12/"&gt;Raleigh
Furley&lt;/a&gt;,
which met most of my criteria. I was looking for a steel/ti, road
geometry, disc brake, belt drive, internal geared machine. This guy is
cromoly, has perfect geometry for me, and disc brakes. It didn't have a
belt drive or internal gears, but as it turns out I don't need the gears
at all, and it's cheaper than the belt drive options. Belt drives fall
into the "fixing a null problem" category, since there's just nothing
wrong with a chain drive. I've dropped oil on it a couple times, but
that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 1000 miles, I've done hardly any maintenance. This thing's a tank.
Okay I'm not sure how much else I have to say. It's get the job done,
fast, and is super reliable. The brakes aren't fantastic, but they work
fine. And they work just as well in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cyclocross Biathlon?!</title><link href="/2012/10/15/cyclocross-biathlon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-15T23:58:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-10-15T23:58:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-10-15:/2012/10/15/cyclocross-biathlon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I went out and did this crazy thing.

Triathlon down close to the cape in Mass, to a gorgeous spot on
Buzzard's Bay called Dartmouth, MA. A big thanks to Pat Kemple's parents
(Mike and Sheila (sp?)) for hosting the motley crew and providing us
with a great dinner the night before, in addition to cheering us on.
Also a huge thanks for Sarah for making the trip down to support me, not
too far away from her new job in RI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triathlon itself was good, although I didn't run as well as I would
have liked (same pace as the 10k two weekends ago). That's my own doing,
as I purposely gambled more on the bike and managed to catch everyone on
our team except for Ike. Coming into the run, I wasn't far behind Ike, I
was right on Jon's heels, and I knew that Pat and Adam would be right
behind me. I attempted to hold off Pat to no avail, bro was flying on
his way to a 16:58 5k, and couldn't reel in either Ike nor Jon who both
pulled away a little bit I think. Anyway it was good, I may have cut the
swim course (it was confusing, about half of the race cut out the last
two buoys that were supposed to guide in, but instead took you further
away), and for a bit of the bike leg was riding right on the edge of the
two-bike-length drafting rule, but still outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the race, I got to chill and catch up with Sarah, eating a lunch
on the very pretty beach by the water. She's coaching women's lax at
Brown in Providence RI and it seems to be going really well for her
getting moved in, she was lucky to find a perfect roommate and friend
who is doing the same job with soccer. Not too far from Burlington, we
should definitely be able to see each other a few times a year which is
great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I've got for this race, it was a good one. I do think that
I'd need to do a lot more speedwork to be competitive at the sprint, and
I'm not sure that I even like the sprint as much. I just went for an 18
mile run today after three days of training, so I think I'm currently a
little more suited for the iron distance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>MCRN Junior Researchers Conference</title><link href="/2012/09/08/mcrn-junior-researchers-conference/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-08T23:55:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-09-08T23:55:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-09-08:/2012/09/08/mcrn-junior-researchers-conference/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Math Climate Research Network (MCRN) was one of the things that

originally turned me on to coming to UVM to potentially work on climate
things, when I was just looking at schools. Thinking back to that, I
haven't made as great of an effort to get involved as I perhaps should
have, but this opportunity to get involved was great. I'm not sure how
much work I'm going to be doing that is relevant to this group, but I
learned a lot about what they're doing, and the Data Assimilation (DA)
definitely has some ties to a broader sense of what Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flights were the only ones that made it down and back without an
overnight delay (Lewis 1/2, Nick 2/2 delayed overnight) so kudos to
JetBlue for pulling that one off. Stepping off of the plane into NC, the
humidity knocked me flat. Maybe I had gotten accustomed to it when I
lived down there, but the whole week I was yearning for some fresh
Vermont air. I did get out for one run, and a swim on Saturday, so I
wasn't at a total loss for training (not like I actually have a training
plan). It is hard to find time to get out with all day meetings and only
a free hour or so before a group dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights included (beyond learning about the mathematics of
climate research thrusts)... the hush puppies, shuffleboard, and meeting
a great group of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Lake George Triathlon (Olympic)</title><link href="/2012/09/01/lake-george-triathlon-olympic/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-01T21:51:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-09-01T21:51:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-09-01:/2012/09/01/lake-george-triathlon-olympic/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My first fall race with UVM triathlon was a blast and I'm still pumped

&lt;h4&gt;Traveling to Carolyn's&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of us from UVM went to the race, and I met up with Pat at 3:30 to
pick up our two passenger vans for the weekend. The logistics all worked
out really smoothly, props to Pat for planning. We left closer to 5,
after getting stuck in traffic from our 4:15 departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride down felt longer, and I handed over the driving to Mary after
picking up our packets in Lake George. Perhaps the only hiccup of the
weekend (besides forgetting my goggles, more on that later), was missing
the PPU and having to drive 20min back, but the goodies were worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got sweatshirts (anything that isn't a t-shirt is automatically
awesome), socks, red bull, water bottles, and lots of schwag along with
our numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Swim&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After everything in transition set up perfectly (finding all the screws
for the disc wheel was quite a massive challenge), the only thing I
didn't have were swim goggles, 15min before the race! Luckily Alisa
bailed my butt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most hectic and aggressive swim start that I've ever been a part of
it, this one was nuts. I definitely got elbowed in the face a few times,
before getting too worked up and dropping back. My breathing was tight
in the wetsuit, goggles filling up with water and fog, and it was rough.
My arms were really tired from the 1500m in the pool the day
before...mistake. After going off course (and being directed back to the
swim by the kayakers) a few times, I survived to land. Per Dr. Tucker's
advice, I tried out the "bear claw" stroke, but with tired arms it
didn't really seem to pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bike&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a UVM Trisuit, I couldn't wear Va Tech's while racing for UVM,
and had to go with a cycling skinsuit. Definitely not ideal for
triathlon, but the pad was comfy for the duration of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long I began bringing back the UVM'ers who left me behind in the
swim, and was happily cruising along. There were some other guys going
about the same pace as me, and it was okay riding near them. Inevitably
there was some drafting taking place, and I got worried that I'd been
penalized when the motorcycle race official sat behind me for awhile,
then went by jotting something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Run&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly discovered why the skinsuit was not the choice for triathlon,
as I could feel the weight of the still-soaked suit getting out on the
run. I could see that Ian was not too far ahead of me, and being a good
runner, I set my sights on catching him. Eventually I did, and also
thought that when I saw Mary she was ahead of me as well. But when I
caught Mary I realized that she must have thought I was crazy for
whooping and hollering at her, because she actually had another of the
two laps to go. Finishing in 44minutes and change, I'm pretty sure that
is my fastest 10k on the books, and I was sure happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything about this race was really well done, including the freebies
(sweatshirt and socks and red bull all are better than a t shirt!) and
the food post race did not dissappoint. The beer sponsor, MGD 64 was
perhaps the only let down, I got one but could barely even drink it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Back to VT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loaded back up in the vans we set out on the return trip, and I again
drove, but only for the first half this time. Stopping for ice cream at
Stewarts, I loaded up on water and iced tea and was good to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Shelburne Sprint: the #storylab showdown</title><link href="/2012/08/27/shelburne-sprint-the-storylab-showdown/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-27T21:40:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-08-27T21:40:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-08-27:/2012/08/27/shelburne-sprint-the-storylab-showdown/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rumors began to circulate the office that both of the #storylab leaders

Chris and Peter were contesting the Shelburne Sprint Triathlon, and the
buzz grew. Since coming to UVM in the spring, young grad student Andy
had been waiting for a shot at racing against the speedy Dodds, and we'd
all heard stories that Chris had been training by carrying 50 pound
rocks over his head while leaping around the island. Surfer
extraordinaire and PhD student Cathy had been looking to complete her
first triathlon, and grad student Morgan had been spotted churning out
laps in the UVM pool between bouts of running to drink beer #hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans to bike to the race were spoiled when I awoke an hour before
the start, and rushed to get there, thinking I would definitely miss the
race. It turned out that Peter was actually out of town, and Cathy
nearly missed the start as well. Morgan and I began to wonder if Chris
was even going to show, noticing his tweets about NYT pieces when we
were getting ready for the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, Chris and then Cathy did arrive, and the gang of four began our
triathlon journey. A shallow swim allowed Reagan to utilize the dolphin
dive (wearing toe shoes for the zebra mussels) technique to gain an
early lead on the whole field. Chris had hung back to avoid getting
kicked in the face, and the wetsuitted Reagan was out of the water
first.&lt;/p&gt;

butterfly?[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without biking the entire summer, I'm not sure how Chris managed to
average 20MPH over the 15 mile loop on his old steel steed, but he did.
Riding in time trial position, I had a good bike leg, and Morgan didn't
lose much time. Cathy was riding was it likely the heaviest bike in the
race, a mountain bike at that, and finished in good time considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-08-27-at-1-46-33-pm.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-08-27-at-1-46-33-pm.png?w=202" title="Screen Shot 2012-08-27 at 1.46.33 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading out on the run, I saw Chris and then Morgan (and Nuts from
#hashing) coming in on the bike, and I was feeling good. After the
turnaround on this out-and-back run, I spotted a dude that had to be
about 300m back from me who looked my age. A friendly nod to eachother
was followed by a craning of necks to spy the age on the other's calf.
His compression sleeves obscured his number, but since he was looking as
well, I assumed that he was in my age group. So I stepped on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;

Feeling good![/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triathlon is an individual effort for most people, as it had always been
in the past for me. There are waves starting in front and behind you, so
you can never know if the people on the course next to you even started
at the same time. So you're doing your own race. The professionals
however are racing. They are all together, and out on the run their
finishing place is their actual place. That's what I felt like, knowing
that this other guy was coming for my age group and we had started at
the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

the competition![/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking my watch, I was at a 6:30 pace and if he could bring me back at
that...I figured kudos to him. I never saw him again, and had actually
pulled away to my satisfaction. I credit my finishing pace to everyone
else on the course out there. A lot of people were heading out as I was
coming in, and I gave high fives to every willing runner on the way out.
Rather than slow me down, I realized after one high five that by feeding
off of that positive energy, I could run even faster. And it felt great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best overall finish, I was in 6th overall, and also a first: not
chicked. At least I think it's a tri/running first. Very happy with my
performance, I was glad to see Chris finish strong with his son Afton
and Morgan cross his first finish line. Cathy came through after and
achieved her goal as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twas a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

National Tri that took place in Burlington VT. Two races took place that
weekend, an olympic and a sprint distance, and it was tough to not
compete when the start line is a 1 mile walk away. There were no
qualifying requirements for the sprint, and it was cheaper, so I signed
up a few weeks before the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at my calendar, I realized that this was going to be the first
of a triathlon streak that would last at least 3 weeks, and I was
excited. Before races, I find myself easing my own nervers by thinking
that I won't need to go very fast, I'll just go my own pace and it will
be fine. Grayson Cobb stayed with us the week before the race, and with
him around talking about going top 10 overall, it's tough not to want to
crush it though. I was amped to race, and volunteer for the Olympic the
day before on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Volunteering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked for the USADA as an athlete chaperone, there were 16 of us that
each got the name of an athlete who was had been "randomly" selected to
pee in a cup. We were to stand in the finish area and escort our person
to the USADA tent, and it was a pretty good gig. I was able to see a lot
of friends finish, get a cool t-shirt, and eat Moe's as a volunteer for
the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Racing on Sunday: pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having dropped my race bike off on Saturday for check-in, I woke up too
late to walk to the start so I rode my commuter down. Pretty freaking
rare to do a triathlon without any driving involved, it's not a very
"green" sport. But this race was all people powered transportation for
me. I was all set in transition well before the race, and waited around
for the very last of 19 waves to go off- the young guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Swim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in the docks by the Community Sailing Center, I hung on to the
group for a good 100m, but it wasn't too long before I was swimming
alone. Coming back at the shore, we were looking straight into the sun
and it was tough to see where I was going, but I made a roundabout way
out of the water eventually. The swim took me 17 minutes, compared to
fastest guys getting out in 10. Not looking good for me to place in the
sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bike&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike course was dissappointing in that as a local of Burlington, I
had never ridden it and never will again...it was on a highway. And we
had to do this silly thing where we got off an onramp, turned around,
and got right back on. Presumably to add distance, but they could have
just sent us further down Pine St. I rode as hard as I thought I should,
looking forward to loosening up the stride on the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out for what turned out to be a good run for me. I got out of
transition without my number belt, but a volunteer grabbed it for me
without much loss in time. Headed up the very familiar Depot St to
start, I chopped my way up it, and then tried to let it rip after. I was
going well, and passing a lot of people (including in the bike, perhaps
a false sense of speed) out on North St. Coming back down to the bike
path was fast, and I enjoyed going back and forth with some Navy guys as
we approached the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the line I felt great, and the Moe's burritos were good again. I
even managed to get a tub of guacamole that lasted me for a week, yum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race won't be in Burlington again, since it rotates every year, but
I can see that it would be really fun to travel out the week before the
race to see a new place and do a well organized triathlon. Secretly I'm
hoping they'll bring Coll Nats up north, but since it's early in the
spring, that doesn't seem likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The ride&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing Vermont's motorcycle course on Sunday afternoon, I
bought a 1993 Honda Nighthawk 750 that night. Then proceeded to ride it,
with a 60lb frame backpack, on roads for the first time to the
Adirondacks to meet Sam and hike for the week. Most advice is to start
on a 250cc motorcycle, which is what we rode in the Vermont course, oh
well. I didn't have a helmet either, but the guy I bought it from gave
me his. It fit okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I survived the ride, despite the massive headwind riding south to NY,
the darkness and (stinging at 60mph) rain, and having to barter for gas
in NY where the power was out in the whole region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The search&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at "The Garden" parking lot somehow, I set off on the trail.
Leaving only a note to the parking attendant that I didn't know how much
to pay for a motorcycle (and not having change anyway), I left with one
of those nagging little worries that my bike was going to get towed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever hiked in the dark, by yourself, on new trails, in the
rain...this next part might make more sense. Wanting to just finish the
hike, I didn't bother to take off my thick flannel, uncomfortable boots,
or long pants that I'd worn for protection on the motorcycle. Nor did I
know that there was a helmet lock on the bike, so I strapped the helmet
to my already heavy bag too. Set for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hiking for-well, I wasn't sure how long-it felt like I'd been
climbing a mountain and should have already passed the...well I didn't
know where Sam was going to be. I was burning up in what I was wearing,
and thought I'd taken the wrong trail. Turns out I'd been hiking for an
hour, and was on the right trail, but I only realized these things after
hiking back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours gone, I set back out, with the heavy wet clothes now on my
back and the boots still rubbing my feet raw. Eventually I made it to
the Johns Brook Lodge, where I expected to find the Spisiak party. But,
they weren't there, I was informed after waking up the rest of the
campers. The only indication I'd had of there whereabouts were Sam
mentioning lean-to's in a txt earlier, and their trailhead sign-in which
said "loj." At the second sign-in, not far from the JBL, they hadn't
signed in. It was late, but the lean-to's weren't far and I wanted to
find Sam really bad. I ditched the pack and set off with running shoes
and shorts, a t-shirt, my garmin, a headlamp, and a laminated cartoon
map of the area in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the first set of three lean-to's on the other side of John's
Brook, with no Sam. There was another lean-to on the map, further
away...but I'd come this far. I went back to where it should have been,
but couldn't find it from any trails. The map had it next to a stream,
and so I bushwacked down the stream, walking a little bit each
direction, nothing to see from the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went back up to the stream-side trail...it wasn't there. I must
have gone too far along the stream. I searched for it, to no avail. I
pushed back down to the stream, and began to follow it downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lost in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I would have to reach the Ausable River, I figured. Luckily,
a trail bridge crossed the stream, and I got up to that trail. It had
red markings, which I was unfamiliar with, and the little trail map I
had was useless. I hiked one way, and was definitely going up a
mountain. Around I went and back across the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two beady eyes on the trail look back at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't have been hiking at night, the trailhead warned. Bears are
prevelant. I don't have anything to make noise with. I flick my headlamp
to spotlight mode, and it's a deer. PHEW. Continuing on, I suddenly
reach the JBL from an entirely different direction. WOW. I had indeed
been hiking up to Marcy, and I have no idea how I found the Lodge that
night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The hike&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning at 5AM, I was awoken by Grace (at the time, some young
blonde girl I didn't know), but then I head Sam's voice. YES! It was
them! They came by the lodge! The few hours of sleep I'd had on the
benches in the lodge (the mice bothered me too much on the floor)
weren't great, but I can lose 1 night, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out with an ambitious plan of 7 high peaks in one day. We hiked,
we rock climbed, Sam almost had a panic attack on the cliff, we ran out
of water, and we crushed 6 peaks that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired, we skipped on tenting it that night, and hiked our heavy packs
back out for the night. Riding the motorcycle without the load was great
actually (I threw my pack in the Roger's truck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More fun back at the cabin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the week wasn't nearly as nuts, although I didn't quite
realize how long the road climb up Whiteface was until I climbed on it
on Sam's mountain bike (which was too small, lacked clipless pedals, and
a bit heavier than my racing machine) for the full 3500ft. Luckily, I
didn't break 15 minutes from the best time, so I didn't have to buy Sam
the jersey at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other highlights from the rest of the trip were some A&amp;amp;W fun, another
(easier) couple hikes, canoeing, and eating lots of food. Oh, and I got
to chop down trees with an axe...always fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I headed back for the Vermont Brewer's Fest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;

apparently), Sam continued to work on the giant Jenga set for Matt and

&lt;h4&gt;Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I slept in for a long long time (Worlds really did kick my butt
apparently), Sam continued to work on the giant Jenga set for Matt and
Kelsey's wedding gift. By the time I got up, she was almost done
staining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights for the day included going on a trail run/ride (I ran, Sam
rode) w Rachel in the afternoon and shooting a round of disc golf w
Bradner. For dinner, we met my cousin Mary Kate at Cabo Fish Taco, and
that was great seeing her. She's due in two weeks, and is doing really
well! Chris couldn't make it with a nephew in town, but the tacos again
did not disappoint! Note: try to make that spinach dip at home...yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards drinks w Paul and Ruthie got competitive, and you can be the
judge of the following drawings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Friday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Friday was concerned with the following ride, followed by a
yummy Chipotle burrito, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out: &lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/186913475"&gt;http://connect.garmin.com/activity/186913475&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having never been to Floyd for a Jamboree myself, Sam and I headed down
to the south, west corner of Virginia for a real southern experience.
Every Friday night, Floyd is host to a jamboree, which basically means
banjo, fiddle, upright bass, and guitar players of all sorts fill the
streets for live, local, homegrown music. We got some local ice cream,
and even went for a really good pizza (and a super good Ommegang beer)
at a little brick oven pizza joint w music playing. Here's some of the
music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hjfjlu5eFA&amp;amp;feature=plcp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making final touches to the Jenga set, loading up the car, and
going to an amazing breakfast at Gillies (and seeing the guys off on the
their long ride from Bollos), Sam and I headed for Boydton, Virginia.
Located in the middle of nowhere, near the NC border, we managed to
severely confuse the GPS unit by hopping on the Blue Ridge Parkway for a
little while, but still made it in time to be ready for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/2012-06-09_18-34-09_117.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/2012-06-09_18-34-09_117.jpg?w=224" title="2012-06-09_18-34-09_117"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wedding itself was fantastic, on the waterfront at the Preddy's
gorgeous home. And the reception was even more fun, filled with dancing
and complete with open bar. It was really great to see a lot of my
family, and I was super glad to be there to see Matt and Kelsey embark
on their journey together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one will be short: 14 hours of driving back to Vermont!! Although
there are a few highlights: which include making the trip alive, and
getting 38.5mpg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading :)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Virginia Adventure update</title><link href="/2012/06/07/virginia-adventure-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-07T00:29:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-06-07T00:29:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-06-07:/2012/06/07/virginia-adventure-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spanning the weddings of Hayden Shea + Mariah Kalil and my cousin Matt

&lt;p&gt;Hayden's wedding was great: a beautiful ceremony followed by a fun
reception that included kind words from the parents, dancing, and an
open bar of course. I'm super happy for him, and hope the best for them
both together, and hope he enjoys the Phillies game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating DC was interesting, and wasn't too bad, as Sam and I managed
to find me a new dress shirt the morning of the wedding and get me a
&lt;a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjQ4MjU5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY5NzAzNw@@._V1._SY314_CR13,0,214,314_.jpg"&gt;haircut&lt;/a&gt; at
the "ethnic" barber shop before 2PM (we moved on Thursday, and left
early Friday morning which meant packing by headlight late on Thursday
night after a long day, and things were forgotten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into Blacksburg on Sunday, I listserved an email for a mountain
bike ride at 6PM to announce my arrival to my friends on the team and
because I needed to hit the trails that I had been missing. We took the
scenic way into town along 311 and Blacksburg Rd, and were back in time
to get ready to ride. David joined me for what was an excellent ride,
pushing my boundaries of what I thought was "rideable" terrain. Sam
claimed to have fun riding up and down Old Farm, one of the most
technical trails on the east coast, for an hour and half which is
impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mountain bike had been creaking, so we rode up to East Coasters and
after chipping away some of the paint around the crack that I had
noticed, Kirby confirmed that the LOUD creaking noise was indeed the
frame cracking. I find this super interesting, because the crack(s)
aren't due to crashing, but rather from stress on the down tube.
Aluminum has no "fatigue limit," which means that when the metal is
stressed it incurs damage, regardless. Steel has such a limit, which
means it won't weaken below a certain threshold, and titanium is similar
but with a much higher threshold. So as would actually be expected, the
Al gave in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest Cannondale dealer was "Just the Right Gear" (awesome name
for a shop) about 40 minutes away, so back out Blacksburg Rd we went.
They said that it should be warrantied by Cannondale, so I'll be excited
to get a new frame if that happens. Slightly bummed that I'm not out
mountain biking on these trails, but the running on them and the biking
around here were equally missed. Hopefully they'll send me a new bike,
because about everything on the bike is giving out, the frame just
finally went along. The brakes have air in the lines, the rotors are
warped, both rims are ruined, front hub bearings are gone, it doesn't
shift great anymore, and the front fork needs to be rebuilt. Soooo
perhaps it's all worn enough to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, dropped off the bike and since we were right next door, it
seemed like a perfect opportunity to run up McAfee's Knob, the most
amazing view on the East (it is the most photographed spot on the AT).
Without hardly any time before we were supposed to be back in town for
dinner with Ruthie, we had to run it pretty quick, and that's what Sam
and I set off to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took off after a mile or so, and took a quick peek at the top before
heading back down. My HR at the top was a solid 180, so the engine was
definitely working. I didn't think I'd see Sam for a while, so I took
off flying on the way down, nearly sprinting, since we were short on
time. But before I was 5 minutes down, I ran into Sam. She'd been doing
work, and being that close to the top she definitely deserved to see it.
She didn't take too well to my "okay, you got 30 seconds at the top to
soak it in" comment, so we spent a minute or two up top...incredible
vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a jamacian shower on the way back into town, we made it only a few
minutes late to t Ruthie's for an amazing dinner she had prepared of
Spinach Lasagna, Salad, and dessert of a pan of peanut butter cookies
with chocolate chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was equally action packed, including a good 30 mile bike ride,
disc golfing in the morning, and building a wedding present for Matt and
Kelsey. It was Sam's first time on Chrissy's old road bike, which with
the seat at Sam's height has nearly as much drop as my bike, but she was
a champ and hung in for the whole ride. Coming up McCoy Rd was busy and
not much fun, but the rest of the ride was excellent. Disc golfing
highlights include sitting on the edge of tunnel and having a train come
out of the tunnel underneath Jacob, and I, and coming back with two more
discs that we took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was probably our slowest day in two weeks, but still we
managed to walk Everest, go visit Ruthie's horse Scribby, and then
do &lt;em&gt;wednesday worlds&lt;/em&gt;. Worlds was the Tabor route this week, but I still
mustered the courage to get beat up on the hills, and went. It ended up
being a great ride, as the B group wittled down to 5 riders by Sandy
Ridge, even though I was fighting hard on those first few hills, I felt
great. We got caught by the A's, and I actually got gapped going down
the descent so I had to fight back on. On Blacksburg Rd, I was okay but
after only a handful of pulls at 30mph, I was getting kicked and then
dropped myself when I knew I couldn't take another pull (as opposed to
trying to sit on the back of the paceline, I took the "honorable" route
I suppose). Sam did an out and back on Blacksburg Rd, and was behind me
when I dropped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two ambulances went flying the other direction, I got worried, and
resolved to turn around as soon as I made it to the top of Harding, but
I caught Anne from East Coasters on the way up, and upon hearing that
Chrissy had been hit by a deer, I turned around and headed back to see
if she was alright. It took me a bit of time to hammer back there, but I
managed and she was gone by the time I left, but I headed back with the
group of 5 (including Sam) that had stopped there. It was getting dusk,
so as soon as I rolled up, I got the group on the road. I grabbed a
small tail light from Will's bike, and we were off. The volunteer
ambulance followed us back to the base of the climb, which was nice, and
so we didn't have to worry about being on the road and not being
visible. For her second ride on that bike, and really her second ride at
all on a road bike, Sam climbed Harding which I don't think she quite
realizes is quite a feat actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting tons of food in us, we headed downtown and grabbed some
drinks w John D and Jaber, and tried to meet up w Chrissy and Will and
Kay but missed those guys. It was a fun night and I'm excited for what
the next few days have in store for us!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>2012 USA Triathlon Collegiate National Championships</title><link href="/2012/04/23/2012-usa-triathlon-collegiate-national-championships/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-04-23T15:45:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-04-23T15:45:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-04-23:/2012/04/23/2012-usa-triathlon-collegiate-national-championships/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm writing here on June 18, 2012, since I never did get a chance to sit

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in short, I had a great deal of fun and am very grateful having
been able to take part in a "national championship." My race was far
from national caliber, and actually a bit disappointing with my (lack
of) ability to swim. Here are some highlights that I can recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I almost missed the plane (my alarm failed, phone was off, and Eric
    woke me up because tri kids almost banged the door down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire trip down, it was the UVM Tri skinsuit babyyy (securing
    my bet of four energy bars from @ttmill)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flatulence was common theme, as I was repeatedly out-done by one
    Colby Nixon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note to self: don't wear a wetsuit that's way too small, kill
    yourself at 185bpm for a 35min swim, then be exhausted for your two
    decent legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\^ that's what happened in my race, whoops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the strip-malls indistinguisable from the rest of America,
    Tuscaloosa is a nice place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorority girls at UA wear "norts"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullets, mustaches, and very short jean shorts were a hit (before,
    during, and after the race I might add)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was really great catching up w Va Tech folks I hadn't seen in
    awhile...we dominated Olive Garden with a party of 35&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I slept on a park bench downtown one night (for a few hours, I was
    tired after all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's a pretty solid trip.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>SIAM Conference on Uncertainty Quantification</title><link href="/2012/04/06/siam-conference-on-uncertainty-quantification/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-04-06T15:59:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-04-06T15:59:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-04-06:/2012/04/06/siam-conference-on-uncertainty-quantification/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Official statement:&lt;/p&gt;

been excited about for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
The drive was long, so we departed at 2:30 from UVM. I actually knew
that we weren't going to be leaving right at 2:30 judging by the first
weekend, so I took my time a little bit and got there by 2:50. We were
on the road by 3:05. Some of the best times on bike race weekends are
the conversations and fun had in the vans while travelling between
races, and this drive was not at all a disappointment. At some point, we
always talk about bikes, but spend most of the time talking about just
everything. We arrived in Philadelphia at Joe Kopena's house at 11,
making the drive an 8 hour haul with a stop and some bad directions from
GPS.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
The number of times that I've been let down recently by GPS has
destroyed my faith in the technology, and for the weekend I grabbed
the Pennsylvania map that has been hanging out in my car (random that I
have a PA map). It wasn't so useful, since we spent most of the drive in
NJ, but I was able to follow along with the fish-hook like route we took
arriving in the city.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
Joe's house is really nice, a new townhome in south Philly with a
rooftop view of the skyline. I opted to sleep on the roof, and it was a
nice 50deg with an amazing view of the city.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
My reading material for the weekend was a book that I was very excited
about: Building Lugged Bicycle Frames: A Manual for the First Time
Builder.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;TTT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
First, what a "TTT" is: standing for Team Time Trial, four riders per
team work together to cover a set distance in the shortest amount of
time. You can't draft off other teams, and start 30 seconds after the
team in front. The A team had four guys, and so didn't steal any of our
B team (it's okay for teams to use riders from lower categories), which
was just Jake and I. We wanted to leave the strongest possible C team,
and took Ben Civiletti because he was suffering from a black lung and
took Tanner in his fifth ride of the year. The course was two laps of a
6.3 mile out-and-back, with one short uphill near the start/finish.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
Ben's lungs weren't with him, and he wasn't with us after one pull. The
remaining three of us went hard to the turnaround and back, up the hill.
I was hurting up the hill, and Tanner was about done for. We tried to
keep him on, but by the time we were heading out for the final lap it
was just Jake and I.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
On the final lap, Jake did most of the pulling. I was rotating with him
on the way out, but the slightly uphill way back I could only muster one
pull. From his effort, I was able to hit the hill hard with him and we
pushed strong through the finish.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
I didn't expect much in terms of results from the race, but we ended up
getting 2nd in Men's B, with a time of 29:30. We were only a minute
behind our Men's A team, who finished with four riders.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Circuit Race&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
The circuit is a 6 mile loop in Fairmont Park, sharing many of the roads
of the TT in the morning. The roads were nice, with a few sections of
roughness and a few tight corners. Features of the course were the same
little hill as the TT, and another 3 minute climb, with the remainder of
the course flat and FAST. In Men's B, we were slated for four laps.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
From the start, I stayed sort of near the front but tucked securely in
the field. For the most part, we just went super fast. Getting separated
from the field by small amounts into some of the flat sections made it
hurt bad, but putting it into a small gear for the climbs I actually had
no problem. I took good position coming into the final hill, but let
myself be engulfed by the field before the hill and ensuing sprint to
the finish. In retrospect, I felt alright and should have been more
aggresive. But I'll take a field finish with the rubber side down for
this one.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Crit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
In short, it was a fun 4-corner crit on Temple campus with some rough
road in parts, but still safe. Actually I think the B field was the only
one without a crash. Highlights of the race were attacking for a prime
into corner 1 (then taking that same hard corner the next time with one
hand to make a pistol hand gesture to the UVM guys watching), making
some other fun little moves, and seeing Jake win the field sprint for
2nd place, while my final move for position didn't pan out and I got
12th in the sprint.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Thoughts on Philly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
In walking and riding around Philly, and at Joe Kopena's house, I really
liked the city. Granted, I only visited the really nice parts I think,
but it was pleasant. The weather also probably made it more pleasant, as
I was walking around with just shorts on post race on both days to cheer
on the later races.

Association of America (MAA) took place in Boston, MA and my summer MSSB
REU project was selected to present a poster at the Undergrad Poster
Session. This was my first experience at a big conference (the JMM is
touted online as the largest math conference in the world at 7K+
registrants), and it was definitely a learning one. I got to see a
handful of interesting talks, present my poster, explore Boston, and
catch up with friends that I hadn't seen since the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the day by day of what I was up to. I talk mostly about the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carpooled down with my advisor Chris Danforth and also along for the
ride were Lewis Mitchell (postdoc in climate at UVM) and Kameron Harris
(masters student at UVM). We left bright and early from Burlington, at
7AM while temperatures lingered in the 2F range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at about 11, it was extremely daunting at first trying to find
talks to attend. Turned out that there weren't any going on until lunch,
so we checked out the conference center and then all got lunch at Legal
Sea Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I was able to attend some interesting talks, get in a
speedy 4 mile run on some great trails with outstanding views, and then
that night Jim, Paul and I met up with Lewis and Kam and two of Kam's
friends for dinner at this really hip place called The Other Side Cafe.
They had Left Hand Milk Stout on tap! And delicious veggie burritos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four of us, and Chris's former teacher at Bates College, &lt;a href="http://www.bates.edu/mathematics/faculty/ross-shepley-l-ii-chip/"&gt;Chip
Ross&lt;/a&gt;
at lunch at the Top of the Hub which was on top of the very tall
Prudential Building. The views were great, and we talked a lot about
bifurcations which I understand, but not at the level that these guys do
who've been studying dynamical systems for some time. Views from the
top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2783" align="aligncenter" width="550"

&lt;p&gt;Everyone from the REU from the summer were in town for dinner, except
for Laurel who was still on her way, so we all got together for dinner
at restaurant recommended by Jim called The King and I. It was great
thai food and company! That was pretty much it for that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Friday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the this post is definitely feeling to me like food and
travel, and not as much math, but this is more interesting for the most
part. The first day I grabbed breakfast, I got two eggs on a wheat bagel
at ABP and it was real good. I first went to support a fellow hokie,
Scott Burton, present his research from the past summer on graph theory
stuff. I went to a few other talks after that were actually not what I
expected, and I guess that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the entire REU gang was in, except that John and Hussein bailed
for lunch, we took the T up to the North End to see historic Boston and
get some great food. We ate a really small italian place, and it was
just us. It felt just like we were eating in the kitchen of an italian
lady's kitchen, and the spinach ravioli come recommended by me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-06_11-37-33_652.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-06_11-37-33_652-300x224.jpg" title="2012-01-06_11-37-33_652"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried again to find some interesting talks, and sort-of did. But
before long it was time for me to do what it was that I'd come to do,
present my poster! The ugrad poster session was nuts, with over 300
posters being presented. It turned out to not work very well having all
four us man one poster, so we took 30min turns at explaining what we did
this past summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2795" align="aligncenter" width="550"

&lt;p&gt;After the poster session, Laurel and I headed out for what turned out to
be an amazinggg run. &lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/140090311"&gt;Check it
out.&lt;/a&gt; Here is the view we
had from the trail on the Charles River, looking back at Boston where
we'd come from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was late for dinner at the Back Bay Social Club, where I got the
dirtiest look I ever have from a bartender, when I didn't tip on a \$8
beer. I've never paid that much, and actually had out \$6, ready to
leave a dollar tip &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; if it cost 5. But 8!? Sticker shock I guess.
But looking on the menu later, the beer I ordered was actually only
supposed to be 7...whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kam, Lewis and I ended up heading to BU for drinks w Kam's friend again,
and it was a fun night up there. I forget the name of the little town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting talks of the conference from the group that
I came with took place on Sat morning. We heard from experts in the
field on Data Assimilation and Dynamical Systems, and I learned quite a
bit. I also got to meet &lt;a href="http://www.amath.unc.edu/Faculty/ckrtj/"&gt;Chris
Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who gave an excellent
talk, and is the head of the &lt;a href="http://www.mathclimate.org"&gt;MCRN&lt;/a&gt; that is
offering a course this spring that I am considering attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to check out of the Westin, and carried all of my stuff (with some
help) to lunch at the Cafetaria Boston w Laurel, Paul, Lewis, and Kam.
Their fish tacos were great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was the session on Mathematics of Climate Change and
Sustainability which was chaired by Chris and he spoke in first. The
first three talks were great, and after that more educations based and
less mathie. I learned from each of the first three. Apparently it got a
little more heated later, about the challenges and obligation to teach
mathematics with applications in the classroom. I had dipped out to haul
my luggage two miles across Boston to Lewis' hotel, the Omni Parker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some free time while the talks were over, and Kam and Lewis were
at the hockey game so I grabbed my laptop and headed to find a coffee
shop with wireless. I stopped at Jos A Bank to ask why my shoes seemed
to be falling apart on the bottom, but apparently it's normal wear for
dress shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2770" align="aligncenter" width="300"
caption="wasn't sure they were supposed to wear like

&lt;p&gt;I ended up stopping at the ABP, where I got a little package of grapes
and little bag of assorted nuts to hold me over till dinner which I was
actually quite productive and researched for, then registered for my
classes this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, we got dinner again at The Other Side and I got the other
veggie burrito which was also excellent. And I had the Avery Salvation
Ale, a belgian strong ale and it was reallyyy good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met up with a couple other mathematicians after at some bars called
the Dead Author's Club, and then Boston Beer Works. They were home to
more really good beer, in particular the Slumbrew Porter Squared Porter
was amazing. It was pretty neat for me to be by far the least educated
in the group, the other guys were post-docs at MIT and on fellowships.
All in all, it was a really great night out on the town and to cap off a
great week in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out of Boston at like 11AM, and Chris had picked up some more
amazing canolies from Mike's Pastry to cure Lewis, Kam and my hangovers.
I felt fine, but the canoli was much appreciated. Upon returning "home,"
I've been able to rest up, get groceries and make dinner, write this up
and get ready to head into the office tomorrow.[gallery link="file"

&lt;p&gt;An update since moving out of BBurg and being in limbo at home: I have
had two full weeks at home to rest up before moving to Burlington, VT.
Safe to say that I've definitely caught up on sleep, having slept in
till 11AM almost every day. Got in some good, and not so good, training
and got to spend lots of time with great friends, the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only natural that I'll announce my resolution for this year, in a
[not really so] public manner. I started by examining the resolutions of
2011: vegetarian, biking miles &gt; driving miles, and no big beer. For
more detail on
each: &lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/2010/12/28/christmas-update/"&gt;http://andyreagan.com/2010/12/28/christmas-update/&lt;/a&gt;. I held the
first for 2.5 months, drove home too many times to get the second I'm
pretty sure (although I didn't really keep good track), and definitely
succeeded at limiting myself to craft brews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Resolution 1: Eat healthy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so hard to be specific with diet, but how can I get more vague than
this? Well, I'm not going to go veg again, but am going to try to eat
better for my overall health (including my heart). With @rumblinstumblin
having a heart attack earlier this year, it was no doubt a wake up call
to me that I do have a family history and I need to watch what I eat NOW
because it will have an effect down the road. So, more recently, I have
tried to cut back on my sat fats, and haven't eaten red meat (with the
exception of grilling fillet mignon once a week ago) in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad has really into this health phase, focusing his passion on eating
well and it has been both amazing and pretty inspiring. My mother likes
to call him "110% or nothing" and there isn't a much better description.
Be it stocks, raising me, looking at colleges, or now eating healthy he
can really get into something that motivates him. And most recently,
he's radically changed the way he eats, exercises every day, and is in
pretty amazing shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking into the modern science of heart health, there is a great deal
of information and it's very confusing (most recently reading &lt;em&gt;Good
Calories, Bad Calories&lt;/em&gt; by Gary Taubes). The answers to the question of
what we should eat are not as good as we'd hope for something so basic.
But, I do think that it can be boiled down to some pretty simple facts
(e.g. Michael Pollan's &lt;em&gt;Food Rules&lt;/em&gt;). I had a great convo w Carrie
Carlton abt all this, and she sent me to a blog that has a food pyramid
that most accurately describes my goals:
(via http://www.diseaseproof.com/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.diseaseproof.com/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.diseaseproof.com/uploads/image/JOELFUHRMANMDFOODPYRAMID.gif" title="Food Pyramid"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Resolution 2: Tracking my mobility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that my girlfriend is 5 hours away, and I'm driving to
Burlington tomorrow, I don't think that I'll be able to bike more miles
than I drive this year. But, I intend to keep track! I've got a Garmin
that I'm going to put on my commuter bike as well, and I'm going to
track my driving miles at fuelly.com (thx @rbsherfy for the tip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very interested in how we design our built environment to encourage
sustainable mobility and active lifestyles, so by keeping track of how I
move myself, we'll see if I put the miles where my mind is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Resolution 3: Crush it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I'm stealing Gary V's punchline, and I don't actually know how he
used it, but by 'crush it' I mean to live this year with focus and
drive. After getting a short break at home, I'm really ready to go back
to school and spend the next year learning everything I can, and
contributing to research. I suppose this resolution falls under the
'goals' category, but the resolution part is to just keep working hard
and smart. If this were a goal last year, I more than succeeded, and I
intend to keep it up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I've been procrastinating packing for my move tomorrow (I haven't
started, it's midnight, and I want to leave early tomorrow...) I should
probably move along. Have a great 2012 my motivated blog followers!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Andy Reagan, B.S.</title><link href="/2011/12/20/andy-reagan-b-s/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-20T23:53:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-12-20T23:53:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-12-20:/2011/12/20/andy-reagan-b-s/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gradimages4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gradimages4.jpg" title="gradimages4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Chris Danforth beginning on Jan 1, 2011 with a GRA. The fact that I

I move on (I get less of a break than those heading back to school!).&lt;/p&gt;

I am very proud of and while taking a very heavy course-load has proved
to myself (and apparently some others) that I'm really ready for
graduate study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wednesday before the commencement ceremony I had a party at my house
in Blacksburg that my parents supported with a catered Moe's dinner and
some carbonated beverages for my friends. It was great being able to
bring all of my friends in BBurg together for one last time, and going
downtown afterwards was a good deal of fun. And one of the best parts of
all was the Thursday morning running that Chrissy, Andy, Rudy, Rachel
and I went on, that was very excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduation ceremony itself was great, preceded the night before by a
great dinner at the Inn at Virginia Tech. We met the Dean of the College
of Science at breakfast, and during graduation Team Graduation Beard was
separated by college but we reunited later that night. I sat by Tina,
which was actually a lot fun, and Dr Brown was the Master of Ceremonies
so I got to talk to him for awhile and get a big hug before walking
across the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Z and Dan K (and Dan Z jr) made it down for some pouch (porch-couch)
drinking on Thursday night and then the ceremony Friday, and going out
downtown in celebration Friday night as well. Ruthie was there for both
the ceremony, lunch and DT that night as well, and I just polished off
her peanut butter bar grad present, mmmm. After the ceremonies, the gang
(parents, jean, dan, dan, ruthie, and I) had lunch at the one and only
(well, I suppose there are actually two) Cabo Fish Taco. As good as
ever. Then my parents headed home with a Honda Pilot full of my stuff
that I'd packed up the day before. With the stuff I'd sent in David's
truck (to be transferred to my car in the Poconos) and the stuff that I
fit in Zdan's van, I didn't have any problem transporting my belongings
home. Or any need for the [embarassing] U-Haul. (I really hope I don't
have that much stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan, Dan, and I pretty much sped back on Saturday, with a stop to get
Alex some stuff he'd forgot in Blacksburg up in Nova, saving him the
drive back. I definitely owed him that. Once we got to David's (I drove
the whole way), I spent the night there caroling and then next day
hauling stone, shooting skeet, running singletrack w Smoky, and having
some great conversation about the state of society with David. The Dans
continued the three hour (claimed they did it 2:20, I really hope they
didn't) drive home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I just finished getting housing arrangements, and mailed out my
official acceptance letter for the GRA offer at UVM, two pretty
important things to get wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming in the next week is... guest lecturing in Zdan's high school
physics class about non-linear dynamics tomorrow, mountain biking with
Sam at Highland Forest on Thurs/Fri, at some point building my free
motion rollers, and then its Christmas Time!! I already got my big
present today when it came in the mail, a super warm LL Bean jacket that
I'll surely need to stay warm in chilly Burlington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now! (For pictures, see my twitter, and I'll post some up
here later).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>What a week!</title><link href="/2011/12/04/what-a-week/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-04T21:43:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-12-04T21:43:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-12-04:/2011/12/04/what-a-week/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first week back from Thanksgiving Break was excellent, and although

was buried in the books for most of the day, I was able to get out
pretty much every night. First for the cycling meeting and to play
basketball with Professor Norton on Mon night, to the tri meeting on
Tuesday night, the TruGold Roller races Wed night, the Betty Crocker
Cookoff on Thurs night, then the Biro D'Italia on Fri night , the Putnam
Competition and race some Cyclocross Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo! Well it's back to books again on Sunday, so perhaps I'll write more
about these events later. (If I do, it'll be appended below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TruGold Racing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland Leman is a professor at Virginia Tech who used to race bikes,
and is now getting back into racing and very involved with helping out
the team. This includes an awesome series of roller races that he's put
together, under the name "TruGold." Basically, we gather in a room in
Randolph Hall, and torch our legs on some rollers with head to hear
races! Here's a video to better explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32296678?autoplay=1"&gt;http://player.vimeo.com/video/32296678?autoplay=1&lt;/a&gt; (notice my red Chris

&lt;p&gt;This past Wednesday's races were highlighted by a bike domino crash, and
a heck of  a lot of racing. Jacob Aber pushes the line between going
fast and staying on the rollers to the going fast side, and in his first
race he came off the rollers. He fell into Naik who was on his right,
who fell over. I was so distracted by all of the crashing that I didn't
pay attention to the fact that I was riding on rollers, and looked down
to realize I was no longer on mine. I fell right into Mike, who was on
rollers, who fell right into Justin, also on rollers. It must have been
pretty hilarious to watch, by the end half of the room was on the ground
tangled in bikes. I felt bad to knocking Mike and Justin over, but no
bikes (or people) were damaged so it was all good, I suppose. There were
a few more falls in the night, resulting one busted tire (Zach), Jacob
later broke his shifter, and broke the cable on one of the rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racing consisted of two double elimination events, the 500m (scary
fast) and 2km distances. The 500m was scary because was a sprint, on
rollers. Scotland (the fastest) was seeing speeds in the mid 40's &lt;em&gt;on
rollers&lt;/em&gt;. And these aren't just any rollers, they're TruTrainers. Super
nice rollers. They have resistance, and a flywheel that allows you to
coast. The coasting is really cool, and even more like real road riding
than any other roller out there, but there is nothing less that I want
to do than coast without slowing at 40MPH after a 30sec sprint. The 2k
races were more reasonable, as I was only holding close to 30 (although
Scotland held 36MPH for the 2k). I was happy to get Mike and John G in
my first 2k race, but after that my legs were pretty cooked. We races
from 7PM-11:30PM, and I took a ride home from John G which was much
appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betty Crocker Cookoff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Bradner hosted a tri team potluck, this time themed as a cookoff!
There was a category for deserts, and as it turned out, everyone made
deserts. Which is certainly not a problem. I made my Mom's PB No-bake
cookies, and now realize why my Dad can't eat them anymore but boy are
the delicious. But they're all sugar, butter, and cream haha. Guess I
just better keep up the running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Group Final Presentations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday afternoon our research group under Reinhard Laubenbacher gathered
for our end of semester meeting, and this time our assignment was to
prepare and present a &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; five-year plan. I wore a button down
every day this week it felt like, and Friday I went one higher with the
suit! I volunteered to present first, and having put a lot of thought
and effort into this very difficult assignment, was very happy how it
went. It was perhaps the first time I've presented with Reinhard in the
room that I felt like I had prepared 100% and was on task; perhaps
that's a sign that I'm maturing in my presentation abilities. Without
the actual presentation, I don't think that these two slides mean too
much, but here they are: &lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Andy-5-Year-Plan.pdf"&gt;Andy 5 Year

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biro D'Italia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only able to stay at Reinhard's after meeting happy hour for about
half an hour (&lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/dashboard?cid=2012064"&gt;after biking up Brush Mtn with
Jason&lt;/a&gt; to get there),
and was headed back home for the BIRO D'ITALIA. The brain child of
Bradner and I, as an addition to the tours of Blacksburg's already
famous Tour de Franzia, it came together beautifully. I was still
figuring out where the stops were during that day, and we had a changed
of route approx 5min before the race began, but dang it was actually
pretty smooth. First, check out this awesome flyer (yes I spent an hour
on this, but consider that I don't have TV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/biro2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/biro2-1024x640.png" title="biro2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route was all together about 12 miles, and the way we decided to run
it was a group ride (staying together, although riding quick) out to the
Foxridge stop. Then, it was race on. And it worked out perfect that way,
because we were able to have fun riding together, then lay the hammer
down on the last two stops. Racing at 25MPH for the final 6
miles, immediately after beverage 4, with beverage 5 in the middle, and
beverage 6 immediately after was pretty darn challenging. Really, my
stomach was just pretty full, trying to stay in the drops in the big
ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three awards went as follows: with the first place finish, Andy
Wentzel donned the Maglia Rosa. A strong effort and smart choice of
route won the Aggresivo Maximo for Christian P as he was first to the
Martini Party, and the Intoxica Suprema awarded to Greg P for a tough
finish at Stage 6. The Intoxica was the toughest award to give out,
because also Jan G's carbonated beverage of choice was Brooklyn East
India Pale Ale, but he had no problems with this choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My finish was 3rd place, behind Bill Lucy and right ahead of Mike B.
David H rounded out the top 5. Somebody has a picture of the whole gang,
but I don't know if I'll be able to find it haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the garmin race data (includes
stops): &lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/132353786"&gt;http://connect.garmin.com/activity/132353786&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putnam Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/should-you-get-wasted-the-night-before-a-big"&gt;studies have
shown&lt;/a&gt;,
I was really at no disadvantage on the Putnam after the Biro D'Italia.
However, if each of the Grand Tours happened every semester (which they
don't), I would be&lt;a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/did-all-that-drinking-you-did-in-college-real"&gt;in
trouble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know what the Putnam is, I can't really summarize it better
than
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the exam, it became clear why one correct answer (of 12) would
land a taker in the top 28%. It's tricky. I submitted 7 answers,
although I'm fairly certain that I over-simplified two of them. So, I'd
be pretty happy with the median score of 1 really, but I hope to have
done better. Had I been smarter and focused on two problems per 3-hour
session, I probably would have gotten a higher score, but had less fun.
(Because there's almost no partial credit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Cross&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same venue (same event) as my first event with the cycling team,
I headed over to the cross races after the Putnam. I brought my shoes,
jersey, shorts, and helmet just in case, but didn't really plan on
racing since I didn't have a cross bike. Jaber was nice enough to let me
borrow his nice Felt cross bike though, and not more than 15 minutes
after being in a windowless room for 6 hours doing hard math problems, I
was willing pain into my legs whilst riding a confused road mountain
bike child around in laps. I didn't want to mess Jaber's fit, so I
didn't move his seat up, and I'm pretty sure that riding a seat 4 inches
too low didn't help me put down too much extra power. I still rode as
hard as I could, and finished like 7th? It would've been nice to be able
to open it up on the flats with a full leg extension, but it was still a
bunch of fun, and I didn't break Jacob's bike (although I did get some
sweet air on it, don't tell him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, suppose that's all for now actually.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Poconos!</title><link href="/2011/11/28/poconos/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-28T15:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-11-28T15:39:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-11-28:/2011/11/28/poconos/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took an invitation from David Henry to come down and spend the final

two days of my Thanksgiving break (I ought to rename is Thanksgiving
"adventure") exploring where he grew up: in the woods in the Pocono Lake
Preserve. David's Dad, John, is the manager of the Pocono Lake Preserve
and that means that they live on the preserve and have access to /
maintain / build some awesome trails around the lake. It's a beautiful
area, and I really enjoyed my stay there. His house is nice, and I
actually slept under the rock wall in David's room. Yeah, for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that David is only 3 hours away from Syracuse which is really
cool, and it's right on my way down 81 to Tech, so it was a chance to
break up my drive as well. On Saturday after I got there at noon, we ate
lunch, went on a mountain bike ride, watched the virginia tech football
game while eating more delicious leftover thanksgiving food, and then
hung out before going to bed. The ride was great, we got muddy and spent
a lot of time not necessarily riding, but drinking out of natural
springs, fixing suspension bridges, riding over logs and clearing trees
from the trail. It was sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some gorgeous views of the lake along the mountain bike
trails, and that was cool. The riding there is awesome. I need to work
on getting over trees, but I'm sure a few more rides that include downed
trees all over and I'd really have the hang of it (was getting much
better after two rides). David broke out some crazy trials mode, that
I've only imagined seeing people do on the trails, and that was really
amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To best avoid the crazy thanksgiving traffic down 81 (it took Stephanie
7+ hours to make a 4hr drive back to Tech on Sunday), David and I opted
to leave much later, and it worked! We hit about 20 minutes of traffic
in PA, that was just congestion from lots of cars, but it was smooth
sailing in VA!! Pretty sweet. Since we weren't leaving until 4, we had
all day to go out on an even more epic mountain bike ride too! We rode
pretty hard for like 3 hours, circumnavigating the lake. It was awesome,
we got covered in mud, and hit like most of the trails out there. Could
ride for days in those woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really saying half of what I have to say here, but it was a really
awesome couple days. And thanks again to David's parents John and Amy
for the meals and having me stay!&lt;/p&gt;

only 5.5 hours away in Syracuse while home for Thanksgiving break, took
the opportunity to travel with Sam Spisiak there and meet Chris
Danforth, Lewis Mitchell, Nick Allgaier, and Cathy Bliss. The trip was a
lot of fun, and I love the school. I'm very excited about the prospect
of going there this spring, and if not this spring, then the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With GPS letting me down on my last two trips, I'm tempted to go back to
using maps. This time, I realized it was leading us to a closed ferry on
the way there, and it cost us an hour of backtracking down 79.
Regardless, we made it, with a cool (and intentional) detour through the
ghost-town of Whitehall, NY. That town is a flash back in time, with a
creepy huge stone house lit up on the hill above town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Camping on Mt. Philoh&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty certain that the park may have been closed, I didn't let that
deter Sam and I from camping out (as opposed to staying in a hotel,
lame) and enjoying the gorgeous view of Lake Champlain and the
Adirondack high peaks in the morning. We hiked in, and pitched a tent in
one of the available lean-to's. (the "pine" lean-to, actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got down into the low 20's that night, but we managed to stay warm
for the most part, I think. The view in the morning made it worth the
cold night for sure, and I didn't actually think to take a picture while
I was soaking it in, so here is some else's: (credit Fred Murphy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fredmurphy.com/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.fredmurphy.com/img/mtphilo.jpg" title="Mt Philoh view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Burlington/UVM Campus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermont, the home of Magic Hat and Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's, is a really cool
state. Not to mention my favorite flavor, maple. Having read great
things about Burlington, the town didn't disappoint. It is indeed
bike/ped friendly, with a shopping ped mall, yet adequate parking
downtown as well. I didn't explore the town much beyond driving through,
and Sam got a chance to hang out at a coffee shop down there which she
said was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campus at UVM felt really tiny compared to VA Tech, which was somewhat
surprising since there are 1/3 as many students. I thought it would be
bigger. But nonetheless, it's really pretty and seems like a nice place
to go. A lot of the academic departments, including the math department,
are in re-purposed victorian style homes around campus, which is neat.
Much of campus is new though, too. They do have a public greenhouse,
which was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meeting with Chris and students&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Danforth's office, as well as his students', is located on the 2nd
floor of Farrell Hall as part of the Vermont Advanced Computing Center
(VACC), right above the Vermont Transportation Research Institute (VTRI)
and it's a nice space. Apparently there's an attic that not many people
know about, that I could #occupy until I find an apartment that is less
than \$600 a month. That's the single downside that I've found about
this whole deal, that housing is expensive. Of all concerns though, not
bad. Probably expensive because it's an awesome place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to meet Chris, and his grad student has nothing but
awesome things to say about him. Being around someone who has the energy
to be involved in lots of research projects, teach two classes, have a
family, be a great advisor, and be relaxed about it all, is quite
invigorating. The prospect of coming to UVM at the start of the new year
on a GRA is awesome, and if not then, with a GTA in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could definitely see myself fitting in really well (everyone is super
into outdoor stuff, they all put studded tires on their bikes to commute
in the winter, and they do research with twitter), and so I'm ready to
see where it all goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Drive Home: Magic Hat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving campus at 2:15, it would have been a rush to make it to the top
of the local hike up Camel's Hump by the time it got dark. So we
would've definitely have descended in the dark, Sam wouldn't get back to
Bport until 3am or would miss another day of class, and there was a
chance we wouldn't even make the summit before dark. With all these
factors in mind, Sam and I decided to hit the road back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we were getting a somewhat early start back, and I had noticed
that we passed the &lt;a href="http://www.magichat.net/visit_us/whats_on_tap"&gt;Magic Hat
Brewery&lt;/a&gt; on the way in,
it was a prefect opportunity to stop! A really fun brewery to visit,
they gave four free samples and I went from darkest to lightest. Got to
try the Vanilla Bean Porter (of which I got a growler for the night),
their Wheat IPA, Black Lager, and Hex Octoberfest. The porter was quite
good, with strong roastedness you'd expect and the slight balance from
the vanilla. The wheat IPA was kinda weird to be honest but more than
okay, the black lager lacked body after having tried the porter
beforehand, and i'm really just not a big octoberfest beer fan because
they're too malty without enough hop balance but their octoberfest was
to style for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive home, with a calculated avoidance of ferries (although it
would've been open and the GPS wanted to lead us that way, the wait
could have been up to an hour if we just missed it), was pretty
seamless. The one thing we missed was to hit a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's, but I
remain optimistic that there will be another chance. The trip was not
without maple syrup though, just let me say. We got back to my house at
a reasonable time, and although the car was a mess, Sam was able get on
her way to Bport so she wasn't driving all night. I was kind enough to
drive the last 1.5 to my house so she could catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, a great trip. Only regret: didn't get any pictures with the
SLR (took wrong lens on the hike). It flew by, as did today sitting at
home, but I have a lot of energy to keep working hard and apply myself
to my classes as they finish up this semester. I was certainly starting
to get a little burnt from working constantly (I quite literally only
take breaks to work out during the week usually), but this break was
nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future: exciting. Currently: happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some randoms off my phone:&lt;/p&gt;

Saturday (Nov 12) and I am really happy with the result. Reducing the
incredible experiences during training to a single number, my finishing
time, would be selling short the real fun in marathoning: training with
others. I thought before the race about who I could dedicate my run to,
and my best answer was to the people who helped me get to the finish
line through their support and awesome times running together. I started
to make a list, but it included pretty much everyone I know, and almost
certainly everyone reading this now! So this one was for you! Without
further adieu, here is snapshot of the results, my pace, and the course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Race Day Morning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awoken at 4:45AM by my alarm, I snapped up and heated up the yummy
kroger brand, low sugar, brown sugar maple instant oatmeal that I
readied the night before. The goal was to get my heavier pre-race fuel
in 3 hours before the start, which is a general rule of thumb to allow
my body to metabolize it during the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rode with Bradner from our hotel to get there earlier rather than
later, and we were in Richmond by 6:15AM, with the race starting at 8AM.
Temperatures were in the mid to low 30's, so I wore sweatpants and
jacket to the starting area. With 5,000 marathoners, 8,000 half'ers, and
5,000 8k-ers with maybe as many spectators, it's always crazy near the
start. But we still managed to find everyone from the team. I gave my
sweatpants and jacket to Erika at 7:15 when she was checked her bag for
her 7:30 half marathon. Needless to say that was way too early, with
temps in the 30's and me just wearing short shorts and a singlet (thin
tank top).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staving off the frostbite by shivering, and making use of an alley (the
port-o-john lines were outrageous), Chrissy, Carly, Stephan, Scott,
Kevin, Greg, Aaron, Hannah and myself were all together in corral 1 in
time for our start, and had made our way to the 3:30 pace guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First Half&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the line, which is only took less than a minute for us to cross, it
was a slow-ish start. Chrissy and I and our pack navigated the crowd,
but it wasn't bad at all having to get around people. The first few
miles flew by, logging some cold, but comfortable 7:55's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to warm up after about 4 miles, but kept the gloves and arm
warmers up for a long time (until like 16). Chrissy and Carly and I and
Scott and Stephan were all just having fun, and trying to keep eachother
from taking off because we felt so good. At the halfway point, I could
just barely feel that my legs had exerted much effort, but could
definitely feel how hard the pavement was in comparison to the trails
we'd trained on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Miles 16-23&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrissy's stomach was acting up real bad, and she hadn't eaten yet at
all. She found an open port-o-john a little earlier, and had caught
back, but at 16 when she stopped again we never saw her. She said she
almost caught us by mile 20, but by then her stomach had knotted
completely and she couldn't run. After 16 when Chrissy stopped, Carly
had stayed with the pace group and Stephan and I had more or less taken
off from the group. We kept holding the high 7:40 pace, and got down
into the low 7:40's. At about 18, I was talking out loud to Stephan
about whether we should continue this pace and finally concluded
(censored) "[screw] it, let's go for it" and meant that let's just
gamble and see if we can hold this. We passed Greg and Aaron pretty
quickly at mile 20, and I felt really great (not hurting at all) until
mile 23. Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Miles 23-26.2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much more I can say about these than &lt;em&gt;ouch&lt;/em&gt;. My legs suddenly didn't
want to move anymore, but I mind-over-matter kept them rolling. Slowing
to a 9:30 pace for the 24th mile made the pain in my legs tolerable, but
I knew that I had about 28 minutes to complete the final 5k, and 9:30
wasn't going to cut it. Stephan didn't hit the wall as hard, and
continued on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pushed harder, and suffered through a very arduous 25th mile at 9:10
pace. With only little more than a mile remaining, and seeing that I had
only 9 minutes remaining, I tried for all I was worth to hit the gas.
Carly came flying by, and not too long after her the faster of 3:30 pace
guys came by me. The last mile was downhill, which made it hurt even
worse, but I dug as deep as I could and found a final 8:18 somewhere.
The last .4 (my Garmin actually had me at 26.4 because I didn't follow
the best course, being in the crowd you can't) I was giving it
everything, with absolutely nothing left in the tank, and I think that I
remember seeing a sub-7 last .4, seeing as I was going with everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am at probably one of the most painful times I've experienced
(cross the line):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/321162_2427155929789_1578285159_32314486_352893993_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/321162_2427155929789_1578285159_32314486_352893993_n.jpg" title="321162_2427155929789_1578285159_32314486_352893993_n"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;After Finishing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They put a huge medal around my neck as I finished, and all I wanted to
do was get off my legs. I found a pleasant enough section of pavement
next to the barrier (still in the finishing shoot) and sat down. I tried
drinking some water, and stretching but I couldn't move my legs much or
they'd instantly cramp. I was pretty much a physical, and emotional,
wreck.  I hadn't seen Chrissy come through after a few minutes, and was
almost sobbing when 3:35 passed and she hadn't made it. When she hadn't
come through after half an hour, her parents and the rest of us were
worrying, and it turned out that after her stomach knotted she just
couldn't run anymore, and walked the last 6. She's pretty torn up about
it as well, but she's in killer shape so she's pull together an awesome
race soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I laid there staring into space, Greg and Aaron finished and found me
laying curled up on the pavement trying to drink some water. After 20
minutes or so Alex came and pulled me up (I literally didn't help), and
I stumbled over and ate some pizza and drank some more water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first marathon after running seriously for only about four months,
I hit my goal time of 3:30 and couldn't be happier with that. If I
hadn't blown up, I would've finished with Stephan two minutes earlier,
but that's only two minutes. I might also have been able to walk better
that night, but in only two days I've mostly recovered (just finished a
nice 15 mile bike ride) and after swearing off marathoning during the
race, can at least entertain the idea of another attempt (faster, of
course).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Pretty pictures</title><link href="/2011/11/07/pretty-pictures/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-07T22:37:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-11-07T22:37:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-11-07:/2011/11/07/pretty-pictures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Among other things (like my two tests this week (tomorrow and Thurs

class, which is extending a model of opinion dynamics. There are two
opinions, A and B, and anyone can hold one of both of these. In each
population, there are zealots with fixed opinions, and by varying these
two zealot percentages and looking at the steady of states of the system
I observe this: (as the % of SS in opinion A)&lt;/p&gt;

I'm interested in (so I haven't implented checking whether they're

Morrison who is currently at OCS and who would have most surely

anyway) the local running store and triathlon team sponsor RunAbout
Sports puts on the Brush Mtn Breakdown 16-mile trail race. And the very
same weekend, triathlon and cycling team sponsor East Coasters hosts the
Rowdy Dawg mountain bike race, with a category XXC (pronounced
double-cross-country) comprising of a hardy 36 miles that includes
traversing the very rocky Gap mountain twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a season on mountain bike racing, and training for my first
marathon, I felt I would never be more ready to complete these races
back-to-back and claim the title of Toughest Dawg in Justin's absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are both of my write ups from immediately after the races from
Garmin Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Brush Mtn Breakdown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly morning for this year's Brush Mtn Breakdown, with the
kind of wind that takes your warmth down to the bone. My race went well,
not too fast to Beast and I hiked up to save some for the return and for
tomorrow. Chrissy passed me on Beast, but she took a wrong turn onto
Mayapple and cut the course by a little, so we never saw her. By we, I
mean Alex Brown and I, who ran pretty much from mile 7-on together,
after I caught him down Snake. He was a great running buddy, together we
had a solid pace and he gave me a couple block shots along the way. The
worst part of my race was when I tried to avoid a stream crossing by
walking across this downed tree, but I slipped and bounced off my right
quad and into the stream. That hurt, but just a scrape on my leg and arm
that will heal quick. Alex waited up a little bit for me and we didn't
slow down for long. He had enough left for a sprint into the powerful
finishing headwind, and got me there. We also passed Ruthie finishing
her 8-miler on our way back. Our course may well have been 16 miles, but
the Garmin doesn't get all of the little turns and twists of the trail,
especially when I'm flying down it. I think the 8-mile on the other hand
was a little longer, at like 8.5. And special props to Chris Crowley for
finishing on a busted ankle at mile 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Super D&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after getting home from the running race, I was headed back up
to the top of Brush Mtn, this time pushing/riding a bike that I was to
race back down. I wore everything I had, and was sweating my butt off on
the way up but comfortable as the wind swept across the ridgeline on the
very top. I didn't actually hit start on the Garmin before heading down
the mountain, and without risking death I kept my hand firmly attached
the to the handlebars, so no data. I'm not sure where to get the times
for the downhill during the VT home MTB race, but I'm pretty sure that I
beat my time, even with a mistake (not a crash though, I went off the
trail and had to stop real quick to get back on). Knowing that I had a
long race coming the next day, and house to clean before a party that
night that got off the hook, I didn't stick around for the Chill Cat DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rowdy Dawg&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cold one, although if anything I was overdressed, and this race
cracked me. My water bottle I'd brought was moldy and without a chance
to clean it, I left without it and that combined with lack of
sleep/slight dehyrdation from the night before caught up with me
eventually. I got the first aid station at mile 14, having done the Gap
trails which were killer, and climbed to the very peak of Brush, and I
was exhausted. Cole was there, and he even said I looked rough. But I
got some food in me, some cheerwine, and it picked up. I rode well until
I started cramping on the climb on Joe Pye on the second lap, but
spinning lightly still made it to the top. Made it to the aid station
again fine, and David and Emily were there so I hung out for like 10min
and it was fun. Drank like 3 sodas, but that didn't help much and I
cramped realllly bad coming back up Poverty. Had to walk/spin
ultra-lightly the rest of the way, even cramping while walking a few
times. I finished though, and although my time wasn't great, I think
finishing is what earns the title of Tough Dawg. I wasn't the ToughEST
dawg, as Laura Hamm crushed the course today. All in all, I felt great
about how I rode technically, mostly cleaning the Gap trails, including
both times up that really steep guy while people were hiking it saying
"we paid to do this..." haha, and I wish my legs could have been more
with me to finish stronger, but I did that to myself by coming into this
weekend tired, and missing 2hrs of sleep the night before this race. I
do feel ready for Richmond. And on another big positive, I didn't crash
at all!! Even being so tired. So I definitely think my technical skills
are coming together, combined with going a speed at which I feel
comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/312513_10150353096653111_525828110_8267335_1095315394_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/312513_10150353096653111_525828110_8267335_1095315394_n.jpg" title="312513_10150353096653111_525828110_8267335_1095315394_n"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited to see Laura Hamm before the run on Sat, and she
was doing the 16-miles with her last run being that race last year, and
she was of course doing the tough dawg! So I wasn't going it alone. I
did get her in the run by about 10min, and then by 3sec in the Super D,
but I'm pretty sure that she crushed me so hard in the MTB race that
didn't matter at all. So props to Laura for being the toughEST dawg, and
I'll settle for being just a tough dawg.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>the Campus Hobo Challenge</title><link href="/2011/10/25/the-campus-hobo-challenge/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-25T15:13:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-10-25T15:13:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-10-25:/2011/10/25/the-campus-hobo-challenge/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the second challenge in the Andy vs Sam Challenge Series, we will be

attempting something I've wanted to try for awhile.  The weather has
gotten cold for this one, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, if I couldn't find a place to live for the semester, I had
heard of (doubt it's true) a guy who camped out for a semester by the
Duck Pond, and I was going to try it.  Granted I did find a house with
David and James, but being homeless the questions that come up
immediately were "where will I eat" and "where will I shower" or "what
about my stuff (bikes)."  However, the challenge stuck with me and I've
been wanting just to try it. The days of warm have passed, but the
questions above aren't too hard to answer for a 3-day attempt at this.
Given I'll be eating lunch at D2 every day like I always do and can
bring a camp stove to make oats in the morning and spaghetti at night
which is what I always eat now anyways. The gyms are open to students to
shower. And I'll only have what I can carry (shouldn't need more!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weburbanist.com/2007/09/28/urban-camping-subversive-city-living-from-times-square-to-the-car-tent/?ref=search"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vSyk6SJoF1M/S-cVM54yxeI/AAAAAAAAFY4/zyCGPQzI518/s1600/camping+2.jpg" title="Urban Camping"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blacksburg is the polar opposite of NYC though, and there are parks
galore, including the Jefferson National Forest that has lots of
campsites \~3mi outside of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further adieu, the rules are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the challenge lasts 72 hours (3 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cannot go "home" in that time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no sleeping or showering at a friend's place (how easy would it be
    just to crash on a friends couch for three days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no camping anywhere illegal (not trying to get in trouble here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it is illegal to camp is more of an open question, but I don't
think nodding off on a book in the library will land you in trouble.
What I haven't been to strict about is food, and so you're allowed to
eat out, eat on campus, eat a friend's place. But the idea is to carry
as much of what you need as you can (definitely including textbooks
#sorryback).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge on! I won't elaborate on my plan to accomplish this, but save
that for a post after it's went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The first challenge: Mountain-top Sunrise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, in Sam's case, the tallest-building-in-my-flat-town challenge :-P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result:&lt;/p&gt;

for an undergraduate conference at the interface of mathematics and
biology. Paul, Emily, Jim, and myself were afforded the opportunity to
present our research from the summer, and it was a fun trip. The other
speakers and poster presenters had interesting things to say, and it's
great being a part of the community that will be pursuing the future of
scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

Wisp Resort just over their border in Maryland. It's a long drive, but
was well worth for an excellent weekend of racing, and winning. As a
team, we took 1st in every category except women's b, and I personally
took 2nd in our Men's B 1-2-3 domination train. We stayed a rental house
on top of the mountain that is amazing, complete with hot tub and a 1/4
mile ride to the start of the races and the ski lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross Country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the mountain at Wisp, the temperatures were in the low 40's
with wind gusts over 50MPH. Freaking cold and windy. I had packed light,
and didn't have nearly the clothing I thought I would need, but turned
out just fine. The cross country race was two, 8-mile laps that began at
9AM. Before the race, the majority of us were huddled in the resort's
shop on top of the mountain trying desperately not to freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it goes, it never takes too long to get warmed up on a bike and I
ended up being hot in the flannel jacket that I wore, but kept it on
while sweating my butt off so I wouldn't just leave it in the woods. I
ended up not getting it back after the race anyway, but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the gun, I got a good start and was the first rider into a short lap
of a field before we hit the trails. Being the first one here was
actually the worst, because they didn't have the turns marked at all in
this field so the group cut inside of me on both turns and as we hit the
trail, I was back in like 20th place. The start is important in these
races, and this one very much so. The trail went downhill, and through
some huge rocks and mud pits. Being behind so many people, one person
doesn't make it though the rocks and everyone behind them is forced to
get off and walk through that section. But the guys out front just ride
on. So, I was stuck behind through this really gnarly section and lost a
couple minutes to the leaders. By the time we got out to where I could
ride my bike around people, I gradually pulled up to like 5-6th,
somewhere in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an extremely hilly course, as one would expect at a ski resort.
We had gone down the mountain to begin, rode a couple miles at the
bottom, and went up and down to the top for the rest. The climbs were
not technical, mostly on fire roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first lap a good number of people behind me had given up
because of the cold and the combination of getting wet and muddy from a
really tough course. I pushed on for one more, and without a crowd in
front of me, was able to clean the really tough downhill. That was
sweet, and I knew that I had made up a good chunk of time on Bill who
was in 5th in front of me. I caught him on an uphill, and we rode
together for awhile. I was bummed to see Andy W on the side of the
trail, he'd gotten a flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the uphill, I picked up the pace for the steep parts until I was out
of Bill's sight, and just kept going hard till the finish. Passing those
two, I finished in fourth place. Bill wasn't too too far behind, and
Andy W had managed to fight back to 6th after borrowing a pump from
Branson Holt of NC State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short Track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had not too much more than an hour and half to warm up for the short
track, but with a hint of sunlight it got to be closer to 50 by the time
we were headed back out. It was pretty sweet how close our house was to
the course again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite short track course of the year, and it lived up to
expectations. It's got a mix of everything: super fun table-tops and
jumps, a technical rock garden, and a small climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without too much detail, I really enjoyed the race, and got 2nd ahead of
Andy W and behind some NCSU guy on a rigid 29er. I didn't clean the rock
garden every time which was slightly disappointing, but was airing out
the jumps and having a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Men's B (Bill, Andy W, and I) debated for awhile whether or
not we wanted to do the "Super D." The race is a mass-leman-start
downhill, which sounds like bad news and generally is. The fact that we
run to our bikes helps to spread the group out before hitting the steep
downhills and jumps, but it's still super sketchy. Maybe it should be
called a "Super S." One of the guys who came for the weekend to do just
the downhill stuff offered me his sick downhill bike, and having
*thought* the course wasn't so terrible from the year before, I
decided I wanted to do it. Which meant the other two were doing it too,
Bill was indifferent and Andy didn't want to do it, but I figured hey we
were there to ride bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cody's bike that I borrowed is a Trek Session, their top of the line
downhill bike that has dual suspension and 8" of suspension travel on
the front (compared to my 3"). It's pretty heavy, but designed to eat up
jumps and rocks going downhill. I'm not sure why, but most downhillers
don't wear clipless pedals but opt for platforms that have lots of grip.
I donned my running shoes and sweatpants for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the race began, I was one of the first to my bike and was headed down
the hill ahead of the group. Someone was coming around to my left, and
we both sprinted at the trail to be the first in. Well, the course was
different from the year before, and instead of turning right into a 3ft
tabletop, we went straight and hit a 6 or 7 foot jump. Needless to say,
I was not ready to take that jump at the speed I was going, nor was it
meant to be taken at that speed. I launched off into the air, and
instantly my feet had come off of the pedals. I don't know how they can
stay on without clips. We had hit the jump so fast that we totally
cleared the landing, and without a bike underneath me, I went face-first
into the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood up and first checked that my nose wasn't broken, and was quite
surprised that it didn't hurt too much to move. I wiped my mouth and it
was bleeding, and spit out some blood. My teeth were good, and I got
back on the bike to just roll down the course. No chance that I was
catching anyone, but I was somehow mostly fine. Rolling through the
finish line a minute behind everyone else, looking like I got punching
the mouth, I found our team and got them to look at my face. I felt
fine, but that doesn't usually mean too much. But I just had a scrape on
my lip, and my lips were kinda puffy, but no real gashes or anything.
Lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to the house I cleaned up, and learned that not only had
I crashed on that first jump, but so had the first guy in each of the
other two fields. And they were both from Tech as well. Both of them
turned out fine in the end, and one was already back at the house. The
other, Jake, didn't remember where he was so his parents had rushed him
to the ER. Christian had broken his helmet in the crash, and head
injuries aren't something to mess around with, so he was definitely
going to go get checked out. I felt totally fine, but there was no
reason not to go and make sure I was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob and Cecil drove us to the ER, and neither of us had concussions.
They x-rayed my neck to make sure I hadn't done any damage, and I was
good. The doctor actually told me "you're good to race tomorrow." Not
that I had any intention of racing, that was good to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebration/Chillin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While five of us were at the hospital, they had given out the awards.
With only two gravity races the next day, we had officially won
conference! As it turns out, there are separate categories called
"cross-country" and "gravity" for each class, and since the pedaling
stuff was done, they added up the points and Andy W won Men's B. So I
was second, and I'm interested to see by how much because it had to be
like 400-399 close. All in all, we had won the conference as a team, and
took 1st Men's A (Jacob A), 1-2-3 Men's B (Andy W, me, Bill L), 1st
Men's C (Cody B), and 1st Women's A (Kay). Pretty killer result as a
team!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a small celebration that night, and like most of our team, today
I didn't end up doing either the downhill or the dual slalom races. I
was cleared, but both courses were super intense and I didn't feel like
banging my face again. We hung out and watched as a few of our guys
competed, tried to do HW, and came home successful in our quest to
defend the title.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Chrissy's Birthday (and more) pictures!</title><link href="/2011/10/10/chrissys-birthday-and-more-pictures/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-10T21:35:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-10-10T21:35:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-10-10:/2011/10/10/chrissys-birthday-and-more-pictures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;here are all the pix off my camera!&lt;/p&gt;

weekend. On Sat, we raced a XC and ST race on top of Beech Mtn, and then
on Sunday raced a TT and SD at Rocky Top in Boone, NC. Boone is right in
the mountains, and the trees are turning in fall, so it was really
pretty scenery from the trails all weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday night we went to Mellow Mushroom in Boone for dinner, and it was
quite good. The pizza was excellent (veggie supreme) and so was the
beer. They had like 40 taps, and we split pitchers of all of the good
local and season stuff. After dinner some of us went downtown to check
out the scene in Boone NC and it was cool. Lots of mullets and
mustaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross country (XC) course was fun, it was hilly and rocky/rooty but
very rideable. Men's B [I] did three laps, and on the third lap I
cleaned the course, there were two small rooty, and very steep sections
that were tricky because they were after some water. The start was kinda
crazy, we took off up a big fire road climb and I fell from third back
to like 20th as we hit the single track, but most of those people hit
the hill way too hard and it wasn't long before I was riding in
something like 7th-8th. ASU's Ashley James was ahead of me, and I caught
her on the first lap, and we rode pretty much together for the remainder
of the race, myself finishing about 30 seconds ahead. It was a bummer
when I saw Andy W on the side of one of the very steep sections, because
he had crashed and broken his chain.  He let me know that I was actually
in 5th place which was pretty cool. Toward the end of the third lap, I
heard someone catching me and saw two ASU jerseys not far behind.
Thinking that they were some Men's B, or Ashley killing it, I sped up
and tried to hold my place. But they caught me in a few minutes, and it
was two ASU dudes. As they went around (I let them right around because
they were clearly going a lot faster) I asked them if they were Men's
Bs. They replied that "No, were A's." The A race had started 5 minutes
before ours, so I was confused and asked "How did you get behind me?"
And then the way he said it made it funny because I was clearly very
confused, when he "Nah, we're lappin you brah." The 'brah' was pretty
funny how he said it, just real chill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us were tired from the XC, but with less than an hour we had to
race the short track (ST). Usually my favorite discipline, I wasn't
particularly excited to compel my legs into pedaling hard for half an
hour. The gun went off, and I sprinted off, going into the trail in
third place, behind Bill Lucy who was behind Zion from ASU. The course
went like this: S/F line on gravel road, 200ft more gravel, sharp right
onto single track, loop through a couple trees, down a rooty steep
little thing, dodge a couple trees, roll up around a tree, steep little
uphill switchback, gradual climb to a rocky/rooty section, then back out
onto the gravel road into a 180 turn, then the straight until the right
into the woods again. Perhaps that was too much detail, but anyway I was
right on Bill's wheel for the first couple laps and ASU was opening up a
decent lead on us. I told Bill to hit it, and we sped up, but I went
around him the next lap on the fire road. I pedaled hard on the road and
braked less in the woods, and gradually chased down ASU. We were both
hauling, and by the time I'd caught him, we were both pretty far from
anyone else. I went around him, and continued to jam. He got about 300ft
behind me, and I was hurtin, and he started to pull me back in. He
eventually caught up to me, and there were about 8 laps to go. We rode
hard together for a couple, neither of us able to open up a lead, and
then together we slowed with 4-5 laps to go, anticipating the sprint
finish. I told Zion (I had learned his names from ASU's cheering him on
lol) that we needed to make sure we didn't go too slow that we got
caught as I sat on his wheel resting for a few laps, and he assured me
that we had a half lap on the field. With two laps to go, we began to
ramp it up, and I was on his wheel up the small steep climb when
something on my bike went snap, and I was suddenly without a chain!
AHHH! I shouted out of the woods "VT get me a bike!!" as Zion rode away
and ran with my bike. I was slightly freaking out, and kept hopping back
on and trying the pedal because that's the instinct after running with
the bike. I came out of the woods pushing my bike, and at the S/F the
official let me know that I couldn't borrow a bike, I had to finish with
only the equipment I started with. I was sooo frustrated, ready to
finally win a short track with a good deal of certainty that I had Zion
in a sprint. Running the final lap, I finished in 6th place...
Eventually I cooled down, but dang was I frustrated. But, that's how it
goes, and I certainly wasn't the only one on our team that had
mechanical failures (the only one winning while it happened though),
Robby and Andy had both broken chains earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should get to HW, but quickly the races on Sunday were super fun. The
TT was an 8-minute hammer fest, with a suuuuuper fun and flowly downhill
that was also part of the Super-D course. The downhill course itself was
sick, with table-tops and even a question mark berm. It amazes me that
in a TT so short, and myself crushing as hard as possible, that Jake A
and Christian could do that course 30 seconds faster. They took 1-3 in
Men's A, and Andy W and I took 3-1 in Men's B, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross practice tonight at 6 on the MTB? Sounds like plan. Algebra till
then.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Blacksburg Court</title><link href="/2011/10/05/blacksburg-court/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-05T12:29:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T12:29:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-10-05:/2011/10/05/blacksburg-court/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was obliged to spend 3.5 hours today in Blacksburg's lovely municipal

building, and it was quite a frustrating experience. My court date was
for 8:30AM, and I was not out before noon.  In the meantime, I missed my
two most important classes and got nothing done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving what I thought was none-too-early, at 8:20, I was suprised to
see a small crowd gathered outside the court, with tickets in hand, who
had apparently all been scheduled for 8:30 when the court opens. I had
let Dr. Brown know that I was going to be late to class, but didn't
think I was going to miss that, and my Real Analysis class, entirely. We
all sat in the courtroom for an HOUR until the judge came in, at which
point each case was heard one by one.  There were at least 20 cases of
people not present, where a lawyer would take many cases. We kept
hearing cases getting dismissed as "defective equipment" and \$150
fines, and all these people were getting off.  A lot of the cases
weren't related to traffic incidents even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't really even want to waste more time writing about it. I
got off with a "defective equipment," given the choice between that
(\$25, no points on my license) and a \$10 fine but with points on my
license, after I explained that I didn't see how it could be justified
that I receive points on my driving record for something that didn't
involve a motor vehicle. I took the defective equipment and was on my
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was getting the points off of my license worth three hours of my time,
and my classes? I don't think so. At least not considering what I'm
paying per hour of class time, and how important the instruction is to
my performance in the class (and then to grad school, etc). Conclusion,
just follow the laws. Such a waste of time and money not to.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Mtn Lake Mountain Top Trot 10-miler Race Report</title><link href="/2011/10/03/mtn-lake-mountain-top-trot-10-miler-race-report/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-03T17:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-10-03T17:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-10-03:/2011/10/03/mtn-lake-mountain-top-trot-10-miler-race-report/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was an early morning start to an awesome, cold, and incredibly

challenging 10 mile trail race today. Brice, Greg P and I got up to the
start at 8AM to help with setting up if Kirby needed any, so Greg and I
spent the early morning hours making a fire to keep everyone warm. As
the snow started and the temperature lingered in the low 40's with
strong gusting winds, and all I had brought were shorts, I was worried
that I was about to freeze my butt off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went off at 10:ooAM and quickly at that. (Run
data&lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/118340377"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Before the
first mile had ended, we'd turned up a steep trail and were going
straight up the side of the mountain. My heart rate spiked from the fast
start, and it wasn't too long before this wall of a trail had defeated
me. Reduced to a fast hike (with long legs, no slower than those
"running" up), I now understood what trail runners experienced on the
steep climbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the top of that, I pushed on, and without a gruesomely detailed
description of the rest of the run, I enjoyed the parts that were
run-able and went fast on them, punished my calves on the steep climbs
which is where I lost all my groud to the leaders I'm sure, and bombed
the downhills. There were a few parts of the trail that were so
technical that I was leaping off boulders and skid-landing on two feet
before springing off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running with these two dudes for most of the run, they missed a turn by
about 10 feet that I was waiting for because it went back downhill, and
I knew it was coming from the Dirty Dawg (although the trails that we
did repeat, were backwards). So I got in front of them from that, and
with about 1.5 miles of trail that I knew very well ahead, kept them
behind me through the finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Justin M for winning it, and best of luck to him at OCS
(where he is now!). Rudy also ran strong, behind Ig who almost snuck
past Justin at the finish. Those guys can run. As well as Brice, Emma
(who I was super pumped to see there!!), Greg, and everyone else that
conquered those trails.  And a big thanks to East Coasters (Kirby in
particular), RunAbout Sports, &lt;strong&gt;Blue Ridge Mountain Sports&lt;/strong&gt;x2, and most

triathlon and attempting to hold on to first place in ACCC mountain
biking conference (Men's B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I beat every single leg (including transitions) from my first triathlon
at Big Lick last year to finish in 2:29, and am really happy with my
race.  If I learn how to swim, and train more than never in my aerobars,
I could perhaps knock that down even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was going to be to leave from the Tri with Evan from W&amp;amp;M to
head up there and try to catch the short track race at 4PM...it would've
been really tight with the triathlon starting at 9AM and a four hour
drive, but it turned out that Saturdays races were cancelled due to an
onslaught of rain. It had poured on Friday while I set up for the
triathlon at Smith Mtn Lake State Park too. So, making a very long story
short, I drove back to Bburg after the race, and rode with the cycling
team to Williamsburg to spend Sat night there, and race on Sunday. When
I was first loading up my bike in Blacksburg for the MTB race, I thought
we were heading up for just Sunday's XC, but W&amp;amp;M pulled together 3 races
which was awesome, and really tough. Without much attendance from other
schools, VT was able to clean up and win every race as a team with
strong performances in each field. A long day/weekend for sure, and my
body was reelin, but just some swimming for today and I should be
golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll perhaps write more after this week, I've got three big tests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's cross country race was the same course as the day before but in
the other direction. Will M, Jacob A, Robbie, and Mike B had driven down
the night before and slept at the (wrong) race site, and were there
before we got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the race, Will M, Jacob, and I started the fun train. We
were flying, and it was sweet. About two miles in, Will started slowing
down and we were losing the group in front of us. Jacob and I went
around, and before long I'd lost Jacob. And after not too much longer,
Will was gone behind me. I got passed once, but kept going as hard as I
could for the rest of the race. It was fun being able to let loose and
go fast on these trails. By the end, I'd finished in 6th place with
Jacob holding it down for 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robbie did work as well, coming in second in the Men's C race, Kay
finished a mere 20 seconds behind ASU's Ashley James and Jake A had a
better race on Sunday "puttin the team on his back" and with these
efforts, the team was able to win the race over ASU! Currently, we are
tied for first place in the conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm racing Big Lick triathlon on Saturday which I am really excited for,
and I just got word from Evan Fulton of W&amp;amp;M that he can give me a ride
after Big Lick back to W&amp;amp;M to race MTB's on Sunday!! Chyeah!&lt;/p&gt;

Park in New Hill, NC. It was a fun day of racing, despite the dreariness
of the rain, and the beginning of fall temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross Country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Men's B XC race was two laps of a 7-mile course. The course is flat
and fast, and in some places quite narrow. I went out hard from the
start and was the second person onto the trail. Branson Holt of NC State
was ahead of me, and he's a technically skilled rider, and this is his
home course, so I was content to sit behind him. The first loop of the 7
miles is on the beginner loop, which is smooth and fast. There are some
roots, but it's mostly super fast. The first obstacle of note is the
tight tree section here. Taking a hard left through two very close
trees, up a short up and through more tight trees, then a pair that are
about an inch wider than my wide handlebars before it opens back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the beginner loop, it is still fast but with some rolling and lots
of roots, and tight through some trees. Nothing worthy of the title
"climb" for sure, and one section that is a handful of tabletops that
were fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got passed by another NC State dude who was flying, and he went by
Branson pretty quickly. A sharp 2 foot drop into a tight turn and I
flipped over the handlebars, and a dude passed me, putting my back to
fourth. The course is so fast that it is tough to make up any time
though, since we're going about as fast as is possible through the
trees. I clipped a tree with my handlebars, and went down again, but got
up and kept going just fine. The first time I'd hopped back on my bike
only to realize that my seat was about sideways and had to get off to
fix that first ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tight section got the best of me, and I clipped by bars again.
Andy W passed me this time, and I was about pulling the W&amp;amp;M guy who had
passed me after my two crashes back in. I kept Andy in sight, and we
were still cruisin. (So that's three notable falls thus far lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back onto our second lap, I was going fast trying to catch up to
those ahead of me, and coming in hot to the first tight little tree
section, totally clipped a tree at speed. I went flying over the bars
this time, and as I landed on the ground I felt (and heard) a crunch as
my shoulder plowed into the ground. That hurt, and I took a quick second
before hopping back on spinning easy for one minute. My shoulder felt
alright, a little shaky, but I was glad I hadn't hurt it bad. Gradually
I got back up to speed, with a few guys within earshot behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Bill Lucy who had been owning it up in C's and just upgraded
to B's this weekend was on my wheel. I picked it up a lot when he caught
me, and we were flying pretty much all the way to the finish. I had
thought we would've brought people back at that pace, and I think we
were but just not enough time was left in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of the last corner he said something that I thought was
"let's spread it out!" What I hadn't realized was that it was the last
corner, and we had really said "let's &lt;em&gt;sprint&lt;/em&gt; it out!" So when he
sprinted up next to me, I thought he was just spreading it out...until I
saw the finish and started to sprint after him. With a bike throw, I'd
only got back to a few inches short, and he had nabbed me for 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short Track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recovering from the XC race with a delicious lunch provided by
Andy Wentzel's parents, I was as ready as I was gonna be for my premier
event. I was shivering cold at the line, but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took off hard again for the same hole shot, and the short track course
was the "beginner loop." So it was FAST. It included the tight tree
section, as well as a really rooty section coming back up to the S/F
before the open grass and gravel (then all over again!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into the hole shot in second, and went hard. The NC State guy who
had crushed the XC was in front of me, and we opened up some room behind
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back into the open S/F, a couple guys went around me, and the
NCSU guy was long gone. After another lap, he was out of sight. I kept
crushing with the people I was with: W&amp;amp;M guy from XC, and NCSU's foreign
ringer from France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We traded off places, as I learned all of the fastest lines on the
course. The three of us got really far away from those behind us. I
could go the fastest through the flat turny section, and got to a point
where I was only using my brakes on the 180's turns, and going into the
tree section. I was taking those corners faster and faster, with the new
Kenda Nevegals on front and back never giving way. I can feel the really
knobby tires rolling slow on the straight open flat parts, but I think
it's worth the better grip in corners. Nearing the last lap, it was down
the Frenchy and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going all out for the first two laps of the last four, with me
in the front for those and awhile before. I crushed on the second to
last lap, and coming out into the first part open he sprinted around me
and got me at a fence gap. There was still an open gravel section going
into the single track, and I gave it a huge sprint to go around him into
the last lap. I'd locked out my front fork into the last open, and it
probably helped. We pulled even as we approached a 90 degree right onto
the trail, and he sensed that I was not giving any ground, and dropped
behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the two all out sprints, I was tired and had him behind me. There's
no chance to pass during the lap, and I eased up. Not slow, but slower
than we had been going before that, and I was banking on having him in
the spring to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out into that last corner, I reached down and flipped the
lockout, and dropped the hammer out. He would've had to sprint the
length of my bike faster (how far he started behind) in 150m, and there
was no way. I took the sprint victory and went straight through the
tape, my quads tightening up immediately but happy with a perfectly
executed race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hadn't gone down in the XC, no doubt I would've held third...and
the dude from NCSU that won the short track is totally sandbagging in
B's. He said he's going to be an A next weekend. So I'm really pleased
with my finishes today...maybe I should start training on MTB's during
the week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rulebook, which is followed quite loosely at times, it actually
says that if you get five top-five finishes in B or C, you're actually
required to upgrade. But that one is not enforced...or everyone who
raced consistently would be an A, and that's not reasonable. Following
the rules, however, I think that I should be upgrading to A's before my
next race weekend (not allowed to upgrade mid-weekend at all). Not sure
that I'm ready for A's, but I could give it a go. I could probably
handle the short track, but would get destroyed pretty bad in the XC.
Too bad you can't race different categories for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake up at 7AM tomorrow for the second XC race of the weekend, which is
actually going to be the same XC as today in reverse. It was supposed to
be at some different and sick trails, but they called today with 2.5in
of rain, and unrideable trails. In other good news, I just about
finished my algebra HW tonight was well! And I have about 500 pictures
of the races today to upload!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>the Assault of Harding</title><link href="/2011/09/15/the-assault-of-harding/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-15T22:14:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-15T22:14:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-09-15:/2011/09/15/the-assault-of-harding/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long have we cyclists of Virginia Tech and of the Blacksburg
community been held in fear of the climb known as Harding. Too long
has the sound of Harding Repeats stabbed pain into the legs and the
hearts of those we hold dear.  Too many are the souls crushed as the
likes of DeLong, Gargiulo, and Crawford danced on their pedals whilst
us mere mortals are left to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put an end to this tyranny under which we are being forced to live,
a militia is to be gathered at 5PM Thursday at the Pillars of Virginia
Tech with solitary purpose of defeating our great foe once and for
all. We shall flood the fields and take Harding with the watts of
champions. Our ascent over this beast will surely be strong and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is where we fight! This is where [Harding] dies!"&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the militia was gathered, and with the likes of Justin C, Mike B,
Andy W, Will M, Tyler G, Robbie, Zach M, Cody we fought. And we
prevailed. It was windy and cold, but as a team we rode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom, I sat behind Mike and Will. Will went off, but we reeled
him back in by the middle. Cody led Mike Will and I across the middle,
whench the three of us attacked the notch. Mike and Will crushed the
notch, Mike said he saw 770 watts lol. They had gapped me, and I chased
after them to the top, finishing in a personal record 10:19!! Two
minutes faster than I ever have before, I was happy with this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first got the Kazane, I rode Harding all out to have a baseline.

His name is linked because he has his own wiki, sweet! The talks were
really interesting, investigating the topology (...geometry, sorta) of
space. Attempting to answer questions of whether the universe of is
finite or infinite, and what possible forms a finite universe could
have. The going explanation is that of a many-dimensional torus, the
sorta thing where if you fall off one side, you come back on the other.
Thinking about these topologies is really interesting and a fun thought
exercise to wrap your head around. Altogether, I enjoyed the talks for
sure. Here is a picture of me playing one of his &lt;a href="http://www.geometrygames.org/"&gt;geometry

&lt;p&gt;The story of MAN RUN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the days of yore, when gas was only \$3/gallon, math involved
numbers instead of Greek letters, and MTV still showed music videos,
an email was sent out to the triathlon listserv. It detailed an
invitation to every girl on the team to meet at the chapel, run 2
miles, then go eat ice cream at Ben and Jerry's afterward to talk
about Cosmo and The Bachelor, and whether or not they were using the
right shampoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this email was read by the entire listserv. However, in a
fortunate turn of events, the eventual founder of MAN RUN also laid
eyes upon it. He was unbiased, a wise man schooled in the Taoist
philosophy of Yin Yang. Knowing that a dark excuse for a run such as
this could not exist without a shining example of a workout for ALL to
follow, he created MAN RUN: a run where everyone (men AND women) were
invited to come and kick their own ass to their heart's content,
a run where one could get a real workout in without going to a track,
a run to make up for one's own slacking. And so was born MAN RUN to
save us from our own pathetic excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules of MAN RUN are simple:&lt;br&gt;
 1. Tell all your friends about MAN RUN&lt;br&gt;
 2. Tell all your friends about MAN RUN&lt;br&gt;
 3. He/she who is in front, determines the route of MAN RUN&lt;br&gt;
 4. He/she who is not in front, will not lose sight of whoever is in
front of him/her&lt;br&gt;
 5. No whining&lt;br&gt;
 6. If you go to the Huckleberry, you will be excommunicated
from MAN RUN and be subject to 2 mile Ben and Jerry runs for the

 7. MAN RUN is a drop run, but a few merciful participants may circle
back to make sure no one gets lost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semester, MAN RUN will begin at 5:45PM at the Chapel every
Wednesday evening, starting tomorrow. We seek the finest and bravest
in the land to show us and themselves what they are made of. Many are
called, and a lot of them man up and show up. Will you be one of them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE END&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forwent bike racing at Wednesday Worlds (the Tabor loop made it
easier) to attend my first MAN RUN, the first MAN RUN of the semester,
and twas excellent. Looksee:&lt;/p&gt;

habits seemed at odds with what I was trying to do on the surface, but I
had figured out that they were crucial to my success. In Eric Barker's
&lt;a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, he has found science to back up each
of my claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to wrap my brain around the abstract mathematics of number theory
to prove some difficult results, it was quite clear that I couldn't
think as deeply without enough sleep.  This was even something I
realized as early on as freshman year, doing homework late into the
night. After many nights of long proofs homeworks, I noticed the rampant
decline the quality of my thinking as the night drew on (quite evident
in my proofs as I looked back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in number theory class, before the class started, Dr. Brown
heard some of the students complaining to eachother about how little
sleep they got. So he asked them how much sleep they got, and the
answers were around four hours. Perhaps he noticed my raised eyebrows,
because he asked me and when I said "8-9 hours" the class somewhat
gasped. How could he sleep so much and get anything done?? I could feel
the class thinking this as they stared at me, and I quickly appeased
this awe by remarking "every 3 days" in a laughing manner. But I really
was getting 8-9 hours of shut eye every night, and I was the one in awe
of how they could think with so little sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to fit in training for road racing and tough course load
certainly isn't easy, and there are times when the homework pile is
high, but I need to get in a hard 3hr ride. I justified going on the
ride to myself with the feeling that these activities were not opposing,
but rather complementary.  I even literally said to myself during the
spring that strong body is a strong mind, again and again, and stuck to
that.  So firm was I in this belief, that I even wondered how one of my
teachers who clearly didn't exercise was handling advanced calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is, both of these feelings of mine are backed by
science!! So, I've been doing it right all along, according to the
experts. Here is the
article: &lt;a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/what-are-the-rules-your-brain-works-by"&gt;http://www.bakadesuyo.com/what-are-the-rules-your-brain-works-by&lt;/a&gt;,
which is a summary of the book
&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Brain Rules&lt;/span&gt; by John
Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note, I'd like to propose another of my ideas as perhaps being
true: well I thought of it earlier, but...now it's 1AM and I've lost it.
See?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha that's all for now, night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I thought hard (thought back to before I thought this thought,
a train that started on my ride home...and found it again!). Here it is:
we, as humans, are better adapted to gulp down room-temp water in large
quantities sporadically than sip cold water. Here's why: since I've been
running a lot, I've been real thirsty. And when I'm thirsty, the last
thing I want is cold water. My mouth and head get cold before I've drank
anything substantial. But when I have cool water in a big container
(re-used half gallon gatorade bottles, I swear by them, credit goes to
my Bro Kyle to turning me on to them), I sometimes drink the whole half
gallon. And having them sitting around for when I'm thirsty to gulp down
a quarter to half gallon allows me to stay well hydrated, throughout the
day. Who knows...lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's already pretty good evidence we're evolved to run
(&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_mcdougall_are_we_born_to_run.html"&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_mcdougall_are_we_born_to_run.html&lt;/a&gt;),
so why not drink a lot of water?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Long runs and home MTB race weekend</title><link href="/2011/09/12/long-runs-and-home-mtb-race-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-12T23:55:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-12T23:55:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-09-12:/2011/09/12/long-runs-and-home-mtb-race-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Highlights of this past week definitely include the two long runs I went

on and an awesome weekend of mountain biking race right here in
Blacksburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took recovery days on MWF, and they were well needed. I came off of 12
straight days of hard training, and needed Monday off for sure. And not
only that, had I wanted to train, I was SOL, because I was doing work
alllll day long. Tuesday I went on my fastest long run yet, laying down
some 7's early on and feeling strong enough to hold a 7:30 pace for the
whole run. Tired from that awesome run, and planning long on Thursday I
definitely needed Wednesday off. I was going to go to Baker's Dozen but
my warm bed and the snooze button were too much. On Thursday I took off
before swim practice on what ended up being my longest run yet, and my
legs were tired from the effort on Tuesday for sure. I ran nice and
slow, and was running for quite a long time. Definitely hurting towards
the end, I managed to hang on. Then Friday I was lucky to walk, after
2:40 of running the way before, and had a hard MTB race weekend to be
ready for. And, I was doing work for all of Friday until I went to bed
at 10PM anyway. It was a sleep, class, HW, eat, HW, run, HW kinda week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountain bike race weekend was a lot of fun, and the highlight is
definitely my second place in the short track. The results from the
uphill and downhill have yet to be posted, which sucks, but we'll see
how those went soon hopefully. I went up Old Farm hard, but was so tired
near the top that my technical skills began to falter and I didn't even
have the legs to run so I had to walk a couple sections. So my time is
probably so-so, something in the 16 minute range. The Short Track was
just a boatload of fun, because it was an awesome course to ride, and to
spectate. I had as much fun screaming for our riders in the other races
as I did in my own. In our race, I got stuck behind a hole shot crash
but stayed in the big ring the whole race, pulling in all but two people
eventually. For the last four or so laps, I was staying about the same
distance behind an ASU rider, but come the last lap, I gave it all and
brought him in to 50 meters by the final uphill stretch. Digging deep
for a sprint when all I wanted to do was coast, I managed to catch and
pass him on the steep part of the finish, lapping Kelly in the process,
and nabbing 2nd place. The only guy who I hadn't caught hadn't done the
uphill race...so he's a wimp anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downhill, I was very relieved to find that it was not mass-start
(aka death) and went as fast as I ever have down Farm. I hit one tree,
and came off my bike, but was fine although I lost quite some time to
stop and put the chain back on. The Dual Slalom is not my event, and it
was fun to watch people hit the jumps, but I kept my tires earthbound
and quickly lost my first matchup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was the day for the cross country at Mountain Lake, and with Ben
Warren offering me a set of carbon handlebars for a first place, I was
ready to crush the course that I knew like the back of my hand. And I
did just that. UNTIL... I got attacked by bee's. Getting third into the
trail, I passed Jacob and the other dude in front of me, and knowing my
way had opened up a small lead. I had heard rumors of bee's attacking in
this section, and being the first person coming through after the
A-train was not the place to be. Everyone else got stung too, and it
actually turned into quite a fiasco with 4 ambulances showing up and
some severe allergic reactions, but everyone was okay. I felt three
sharp stings on my left calf (maybe 4) and swatted at my calf to no
avail, and kept going to avoid more stings. Instantly my calf was in bad
shape, it stung like a mother to push down hard on the pedals and it may
have been swelling, but I wasn't really looking. Hurting, I got passed
gradually by what was most of the B field, and was seriously considering
stopping after the first lap because I did NOT want to get hit again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling the stings in my leg as I approached that section again, I
relaxed before it in preparation to sprint it. I got out of the saddle
and went, but my rear tire slipped on a rock and I bashed my knee into
my fork really hard, and that ended up being the lasting injury. It is
still swollen (late Mon night) but was okay for a 5mi run this morning.
I luckily didn't get stung again, and cruised to the finish, now the
pain coming mostly from my bashed quad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stings hurt real real bad, I was getting waves of goosebumps, so I
iced and put some stuff on them (not sure what it was) that helped a
little, before driving home. All in all, another weekend without any
major injury is a good weekend of mountain bike racing, and we had some
pretty solid results as a team (recap on http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu
will be posted soon hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Campbell MTB Race Weekend</title><link href="/2011/09/04/campbell-mtb-race-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-04T16:11:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-04T16:11:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-09-04:/2011/09/04/campbell-mtb-race-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m emailing you because there are serious, very serious, choices to

Tech Cycling accomplished one of its greatest feats, Winning the ACCC

&lt;p&gt;Dear VT Cyclist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m emailing you because there are serious, very serious, choices to
be made, and made immediately. On the 3rd of October of 2010, Virginia
Tech Cycling accomplished one of its greatest feats, Winning the ACCC
MTB Conference Championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on the 2^nd^ of September of 2011, I officially lay before you
the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial ASU cycling team and
its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use
its every vessel to destroy the VT Cycling Team and Claim the ACCC MTB
Conference Title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This announcement shows I am a concerned Alumnus. I fear for the
well-being of the VT Cycling, as I see the lack of participate in the
1^st^ MTB race of the season. I fear many of you have lost the
motivation, the feeling of what it is to be a Champion, and never
quenchable thirst for victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is hard to fathom such a fear when VT Cycling is under such
great leadership and carries such great potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can VT Cycling not succeed with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lil Jake Anderson traveling at light speed on his 29in wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Reagan providing his bearded man wisdom and enthusiasm about
every course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay Comer making even the fastest men cry as she leaves them behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan G speaking in a language no one can understand while speeding by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cecil “The Legend” McAllister(enough said)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Luster who’s so fast he had to take a year off school so
everyone else could catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Roberson who does tailwhips over people in order to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Wentzel the greatest keep secret of VT cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Probst who is fast as **** and should be racing this
weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Of course World Class Coach JUSTIN MORRISON, a legend in his own
right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope the preceding greats can win the ACCC title for us,
while the rest of you act like scared freshmen, or indulge in binge
“road soda” drinking, or attempt to talk to the opposite sex but then
realize you can’t, or all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of the ASU Cycling Team is a warfare against mankind. It
is a war against the Hokie nation. The ASU Cycling team has the
strength, the numbers, the potential, and the willingness to defeat
the VT cycling team and claim the ACCC MTB title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each VT cyclist must decide for themselves how it will meet this
presence. The choice you make for yourselves must be made with a
moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our
character and our motives as a cyclist. Our motive will be revenge and
the victorious assertion of the physical might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we
will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred
rights of our team to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which
we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very
roots of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made the right choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email Andy Wetzel(&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#65;&amp;#114;&amp;#119;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#122;&amp;#64;&amp;#118;&amp;#116;&amp;#46;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;"&gt;&amp;#65;&amp;#114;&amp;#119;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#122;&amp;#64;&amp;#118;&amp;#116;&amp;#46;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&lt;/a&gt;) and State the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;(Your Name)&lt;/span&gt; will not
allow my team, my pride, or my country be subject to the evils of the
ASU Cycling Team. I will defend the honor of my team, myself and my
country. I will be attending the race this coming weekend at Campbell
and I will take whatever actions are necessary to make this happen
including pay my dues and fill out the release waiver / driver release
form found at the Rec Sports website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called into action by none other than Ben Warren, the VT Cycling MTB
Team headed to Campbell this weekend for an awesome weekend of racing
and fun.  The racing was good, some delicious road sodas were consumed,
and some people in particular laid it on the line for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short Track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically my favorite event, as it is the most friendly to strong legs
and less technical, I was still a little nervous for my first race in
Men's B. It's a lap race, with this one having about 3min laps and my
race was 30min long.  I started near the back, and there is a seriously
steep section for half of it, with one crazy steep kicker, and then a
flowy downhill, then up the hill all over again.  As I got to the crazy
steep part, someone had put a foot down and the whole group was falling
over and a mess. So what usually happens, the first few people to get to
it and clean it got a decent head start. I slowed up and passed some
people who were walking it by riding up, but still had to wait at the
top for people to get back on their bikes. On the downhill, the dude in
front of me slid out and rather than let me by, took up the whole trail
and I had to stop and wait while he got back on... so it wasn't a great
start, to say the least. On the uphill, since I could ride it, I passed
people for pretty much the whole rest of the race.  No idea what place I
was in with like 3 laps to go, I asked the guys on our team watching and
I had actually picked people off up to 4th place.  Unable to catch the
guys who had a huge head start most likely, I finished in fourth and was
really happy with that for my first B race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than myself, Jake A finished 3rd in Men's A, Andy W took 3rd in my
race, Kay took 2nd in Women's A, and Bill Lucy got 3rd in the Men's C
race. Bill was winning the race by a good but, until he caught a hanging
vine with his neck, and it clotheslined him straight off the bike. He
somehow continued to ride and hang on for 3rd, pretty intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downhill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "downhill" race was a few hours later, and is a timed race down,
well, the side of a hill. There were some pretty decent jumps and some
huge burns, as well as a real gnarly rock garden.  I went pretty fast
down for a normal person, but rolled most of the jumps and tried to
generally keep my wheels on the ground. Definitely got air a few times,
but I need to get more comfortable before flying airborne down the side
of hill. Brian Lusher and Jake put in some really fast times, Brian with
full gear and Jake just beasting it on his 29er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting style of race that I'm not sure why the
ACCC is so fond of, the "Super D" is a mass-start downhill race that is
mostly downhill but also includes some flat sections.  To make the
situation slightly better, it is usually started Le Mans style which
means that the riders pile up their bikes, and the race begins with a
run to the bike.  The advantage is that we're more spread out before
hitting the hole shot onto the single track (trail only wide enough for
one bike).  The start pretty much determines the outcome of the race, so
with a few properly executed swim moves through the sprint, I was the
second guy on my bike. The first guy was in front of me, and even took a
few seconds to get as I yelled at him to ride haha, but per usual,
someone really messed up and the rest of the group was stuck behind. So
it was pretty much me, an ASU guy, and a WVU guy on a downhill bike
heading into the downhill. I let the WVU guy go first on the downhill
because he had a full suspension downhill bike, but I kept up with him
the whole time. The ASU guy flew down the hill, gapping even the WVU guy
I was behind. Problem with the "downhill" guys is that they don't really
have any fitness, so they can't pedal hard on the flats. Regardless, I
finished in 3rd at the bottom, since there isn't a chance to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Lusher and Bill took 1-2 in the Men's C which was sweet, but Jake
had an encounter with a tree (not bad) on his run and Kay came through
with 2nd, not losing much ground to Ashley on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course Run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in marathon-training mindset, I felt like I needed to get some
miles in, and Kay is looking to get back into running form so we went
out for an easy fun of the BURN course, the course that we were to race
the next day. It was a fun run, and tired my legs out a little for the
next day, but was good.  Kay had ridden the BURN 24-hour race on the
course earlier in the year, so it was cool for her to recount some of
the experiences she had during that race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, Cross country race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With slightly tired legs, it was time for the long race.  We were to do
two of the 7-mile laps, and I was ready to go hard, but my legs werern't
there for the whole race.  The beginning was a sprint to the trails, and
I definitely took down some of the markers to get into fourth going into
the trails. I particularly didn't want to get stuck behind on a part
that it was possible to clip out on at the trailhead.  Going along we
were just flying, these are fast trails with burmed courners that are
built to MTB. I got a little high on one burm, and slid out. A few guys
passed me, and as we got the big uphill I was starting to fade. I fell
back a little more, getting passed at the top by Jan, and just crusied
and enjoyed the trails for a while. I'd lost quite a bit of time with my
slide out since it took a few minutes to get my chain back on. Nearing
the end of the first lap, a dude was catching up to me and said that
Ashley was gaining on us too. She's a women's pro rider, who rides for
ASU and is fast as shit.  I told him "damn, getting chicked on the first
lap," not realizing that she was actually right behind him. But he let
her around, and so did I, but I decided to see how long I could keep up
with her. So I just stuck her wheel for awhile, and we actually caught
and passed a whole bunch of the other Men's B's together. I hopped in
front for the downhill, then let her take the lead again as we started
lap 2. I hung on for awhile, but she was flying on the uphills and
eventually she rode away from me.  That was fun, and then I just rode
along until I was actually catching two NCSU guys near the end. I
starting going hard to reel them in, and caught one of them before the
final downhill. I passed him on the fire road since I knew he was a
faster downhiller and he couldn't pass on the downhill. He was right on
my wheel on the downhill, so I was nice and let him by, and came out for
the final half mile on the feild about 20m behind him. I was looking
forward to sprinting it out, and so was he. But when i went to pedal, it
turned out that on the downhill my chain had come off the big ring and
wrapped all the way around the crank. So damn, couldn't sprint by him
(which I'm pretty sure I had), but I had time to get it fixed before
anyone else had come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hot day, and my clothes were soaked to it felt great to hose
off and get cleaned up. We didn't take much time packing up, I had left
my tent out to dry and it had, so that was good.  The drive back felt
short, and then I set to work on my Abstract Algebra till 2AM, taking a
break to Skype with Mom and Dad, and to go to Mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, this weekend is the home race!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Back to School</title><link href="/2011/08/25/back-to-school/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-25T15:57:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-08-25T15:57:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-08-25:/2011/08/25/back-to-school/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Back to school, back to school, to prove to dad I'm not a fool."
-Adam Sandler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been back for nearing a week now, and I just love it down here in
BBurg with the town and how accessible everything is and the mountains.
Seeing friends from cycling and tri that I hadn't all summer was
awesome.  I've even had a chance to work on, and finish the tall bike
that Alex Brown and I started this summer. Riding that thing around
campus (it's literally one bike frame welded onto the top of a full
bike) I have gotten some fun comments, mostly like "woah that's the
coolest bike ever." I am 6 feet tall, and the bike is 6 feet in the air.
I'll post of video of my sweet mounting technique  in due time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes are going to pick up soon, I know it, so while I have time I'm
excited to go this weekend and pick up my finished CHRIS KING R45
WHEELS! They're done today (Thursday) and they're gonna be soooo nice.
Best bday present.  Also I got all of my stuff shipped down that I left
at home, namely my running shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, here's a quick breakdown of my classload this
semester (an excuse to not post for the next three months):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH 4225 Real Analysis: touted to be hardest undergraduate course
    at Tech, I get what follows in an email this summer, and then Dr.
    Rossi finds it necessary to read out loud at the beginning of class
    Monday: "The word “elementary” in the title of the course is not a
    commentary on the difficulty of this course but rather it is the
    traditional nomenclature that differentiates the topics of  this
    course from a graduate level course in Real Analysis which involves
    Lebesgue measure and integration. In my opinion Math 4225 is the
    most difficult undergraduate math course that we offer. If you have
    never taken advanced calculus (Math 3225) or did poorly in that
    class or you have always had a difficult time with “proofs”, you may
    find another math class more appropriate."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH 4124 Abstract Algebra: this shit's so abstract it's in the
    title! I was warned to say as far away from this class as possible
    by a friend Jason on the tri team, but Dr. Brown is teaching it and
    he's awesome, I've had him for a few others and I think he likes me
    (not that that helps though).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH 5515 Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems: seems so far
    to be an ODE class, but good that I have a biking friend from VBI in
    the class. But it's still a grad class. We shall see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH 4... History of Mathematics: Taking it P/F, because I was to
    take it and think that it's going to be super interesting. The
    teacher is Dr Andy Norton, and I really like him a lot, but I've
    heard the class is a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH 4445 Numerical Analysis: the first semester of the Numerical
    Analysis sequence shouldn't be a killer, but it ain't easy and we're
    going to be doing a lot of programming. Dr Boorgard *spelling is
    teaching it, and I like him a lot too, so should be okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World Regions: possibly the largest college class ever, Dr John
    Boyer (JB, Boyer, the Plaid Avenger, J-Bizzler, The Professor...this
    guy's a celebrity) finds it as his calling to educate our generation
    on what's going on the world now, because it does all affect us, and
    it's important that we understand how our decisions affect the
    world. the class seems awesome so far, and is the same one that I
    took part in a stunt in as part of our Spartan Army. I'm only taking
    it as an audit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe some themes that I've picked up on, a couple classes are killer
and the others are hard, but they'll all add up and I might become a
math-nerd-hermit. But I doubt that. Talking about them, I knew all of
the professors, and all but two knew who I was when I walked in the
door, which is pretty awesome. Kk, really gotta run now (literally, 12
miles today!).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>REU Conclusions, Being home and the Great Race</title><link href="/2011/08/25/draper-mile-reu-conclusions-being-home-and-the-great-race/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-25T15:51:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-08-25T15:51:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-08-25:/2011/08/25/draper-mile-reu-conclusions-being-home-and-the-great-race/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The same day as the aforementioned Draper Mile marked the conclusion of

the MSSB REU which was my job for the summer, and I miss everyone in the
program but am excited as well for the opportunity to continue this
research.  I took the two weeks I had at the end of summer, and went
home.  This year for the Great Race, my Mom was the captain of Team
Reagan, and we recorded the best race I've ever been in, by nearly 7
minutes.  Now I'm back at school, and have 20 minutes to burn before a
class so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;REU Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past summer, if you hadn't heard, I spent doing mathematical
biology researching at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, located on
Virginia Tech campus.  The program was a Research Experience for
Undergraduates, specifically in Modeling and Simulation of Systems
Biology and was sponsored by the NSF. Thank them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to work with Dr. Julia Chifman as a mentor, who obtained her Ph.D
in Math from University of Kentucky, now at the Mathematical Biosciences
Institute and the work was done under our program director, Dr. Reinhard
Laubenbacher of VBI and VT.  On my team was Jim Brunner (UMich), Paul
Vines (Roanoke), and Emily Hendryx (Angelo State).  Our team was
awesome, and the research we did in making a discrete model of iron
metabolism was very well received by the biologists at the Wake Forest
Cancer Biology Department who study iron metabolism and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending 8hrs/day getting up close and personal with a discrete model, I
learned a great deal. Jim had greater experience coming in with ODE
models, which are in general much more popular, and towards the end of
our time got frustrated with the shortcoming of the discrete modeling
framework. This current semester I am taking a graduate class in
Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems that, from the looks of it
so far, will focus entirely on ODE's.  I am very interested to gain this
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I titled this conclusions, and so there are some that I can share. I
have made a decision to study applied mathematics in graduate school as
a result of this experience. Math can be very useful in giving us more
information about real systems, and this is what I want to do.  The
specific application of mathematics is something with which I am still
struggling, and am still hesistant about going into math biology
specifically. For one, biology isn't my favorite subject and doing
research in biology increased my level of frustration with the
understand we do have of biology.  There are many experiments that are
done, and we are able to elicit the functions of many protiens, but
there is still so much that is unsure.  Some of the other applications
of math that I find appealing are climate modeling and traffic
modeling.  These are both very real problems that face us, and they're
not isolated from each other. Looking at different schools and figuring
out which ones to apply to is actually quite difficult, and I sent my
GRE scores to VT, Boulder, Univ Maryland, and Univ of Minnesota.  One
professor who I have found specifically whose research sounds very
interesting is Dr. Chris Danforth at the Univ of Vermont:
http://www.uvm.edu/\~cdanfort/main/research.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Being Home&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the program had concluded, with our final Research Symposium, I
came home pretty quick. The Draper Mile was that night, and I headed
home on Saturday. I got a late start, at something like 10:30 in the
morning so it made for a long day of driving but I made it home safe n
sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two weeks at home were very much like a vacation, as both of my
recent trips home have been.  I lounge around, eat great food, ride and
run like that's my job, and go out downtown with my friends.  I ended up
playing more disc golf this break than I did going to dtown SYR, and it
was good.  The first Sunday I was back, Sam from Bport came and visited,
and her and Dan and I went and played a nice round of disc golf.
Unfortunately it was one of my few losses of the season (I ended the
summer series a half game down), but Sam was there so we could make fun
of how Dan looks like he's going to fall every time he throws ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much unlike coming home in the beginning of summer (whence I was
told that I had been signed up for a bike race and a 5K the coming
weekend), my Mom captained a team for the Great Race. I'm really glad
that she took the initiative, in making this my 7th consecutive great
race and with my broski Kyle paddling, we dropped 7min off our previous
best time.  Losing only by 30sec the year before, this year we were
second by 5min, as the other team in our age category had brought in a
ringer in the kayak that with a 18ft kevlar machine put 5 minutes into
Kyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also exciting to see that my Dad is getting back into great
shape, only 6 months after having a heart attack.  We got to go on some
great walks, and my Garmin Connect "Walk with @rumblinstumblin"
(classified as Speed Walking) will testify to this shape, 2 miles in
less than 30 min is a pretty mean pace.  And my Mom is in as good of
running shape as ever, and she came out and put the hurt on me a little
at the end of one of my longer runs, as I had to tell her to slow down
more than once!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest things that happened while I was home was that my
parents bought lake property on Skan Lake, and it is awesome.  When my
Dad told me over the phone as I was driving home that he and Mom "found
some lake property they were going to put an offer on" all I could do
was chuckle because oh how many times I'd heard that. But they did it,
and are currently closing on 5 acres with shared access to a 280ft
lakefront. The property itself is wooded, and I love it. Would be a
perfect place to build a cabin. I'm less fond of my Dad's idea to buy a
10k pop-up and haul that thing in, but he's also looking at building a
garage-house that would be cool. Problem is that it all adds up with a
septic and well, and then up goes the assessment.  It's just hard to now
have the land, and not want to build on it.  But I think they'll be
patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at my title again for the rest of what I was going to talk
about and saw great race, but I already talked about that. Perhaps some
other things to mention there are that my Mom suprised me again coming
in at just over 23 minutes.  My Garmin data puts me at winning a minute
with no transistion time, but with our high number (longer transisition)
and the volunteers making my brother walk that whole 1/4 mile, it took 3
minutes for just the handoffs and I had come in two minutes behind the
leader in 13th place.  And it was definitely the transisitions, because
on the course I caught up to two guys that were going hard enough that
it seemed they could stick with me after awhile.  This was after passing
roughly 100 people (I passed 120-some total), which is crazy. I'm almost
over the yellow line, laying down 24-ish MPH whizzing by, and
ocassionaly weaving through, a literal crowd of bikers to the right. 
The two guys could in fact hold my draft (do 30% less work than I was)
but after two miles of this, when we got to a hill, I wanted to let them
do some work and pull up. It's not even as much more work to be on the
front on the hill, but instead (feeling fresh from drafting off me for
so long), the one dude sprinted around me and the other followed him.
Like, really, what was he thinking? That I had caught him, pulled him
for 2 miles, and that now he was just going to leave me in the dust?
Annoyed, I reeled them back in, and sat on their draft for 15 seconds
before sprinting around them so they wouldn't have a chance to sit in my
draft. Recovering from my attack, one of them made their way up to me, a
guy from Skan who races for Notre Dame.  He was actually cool, and would
take a short pull when I asked him to.  His pulls were very short, and
19MPH instead of the 22 I was doing, but he was doing what he could. And
he wasn't a jerk and let me come into the transisition area first after
pulling hard into it (it was downhill going into it). But his time was a
minute faster than mine, when I know mine should've beaten his by at
least 30sec (I had to first catch him), so that little anecdote just
speaks to our transistions. But, we still wouldn't have been able to
catch the team in our category ahead of us. Luckily we bead the team the
guy that I helped was on, because they were actually in the same
category haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This annual one-mile race put on by the Blacksburg Striders and Runabout
Sports is a part of giant, two-day celebration known as Steppin Out.
It's basically a huge festival in downtown BBurg, with three stages and
&lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of local artisans and businesses covering downtown in their
tents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start line, I found Ignacio Moore who is a prof at VT that I know
from cycling, and he said he was planning to run 4:45 pace so my plan
was to stick with him for the race. At the starting line, there were
tons of us skinny guys in short shorts crowded onto the line and it was
pretty intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gun went off and the fast guys whom I had lined up behind took off. 
Without thinking, I took off with them. We were flying, and in very
little time crossed the (slightly uphill) quarter mile mark with a timer
reading off 61...62...63. Hearing these numbers, I knew that I had went
out to hard, but kept going. Before long, my legs were just big loaves
of lactic acid, and moving them became laborious. I dropped off that
very front group, trying to hold some pace on the downhill, but going
only as fast as my exploded legs would let me. A long line of runners
passed me all the way through the finish line. It wasn't much after the
initial explosion that Ig flew by me, embarrasing. And two girls passed
me, but there was nothing I could do about it.  Needless to say, I
didn't hit the 5-min mark, but still finished in 5:20...my fastest mile
ever! Link to results:

baseball game), I spent a night in the woods Friday night (hammock style
of course) and then partook in the longest bicycle race I've ever done,
and it was on a mountain bike! I was hoping to get some time to think
about what I want to study, and that didn't happen, but the race was
nothing short of EPIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to complete as many laps as possible of a 5.7mi course in 6
hours.  Laps were rumored to take 45min, and Christian was shooting for
50min, so having only mountain biked twice this summer I set my goal at
1hr pace for a total of 6 laps.  There were three categories: solo, duo,
and single speed. Duo guys alternate laps, solo do it alone, and the
real crazies aren't the solo guys (myself included) but the single
speeders. They're riding with one gear up and down the mountains for 6
hours...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirby sent us off at 1PM, to do a small part of the course before coming
through the start/finish area.  I started near the back, and that turned
out to be a huge mistake.  At the first corner, someone ahead didn't
make it up the steep and technical little climb, and there were 40 of us
that had to get off and walk up too.  Then the pace was pretty weak, and
it wasn't until we hit some grass that I could open up and get around
everyone.  It was probably good that I didn't hammer out of the gate
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few laps went without issue, and I turned in some 45min lap
times which I was happy with while still learning the course.  I went
hard up the long climb, but wasn't really feeling too fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Crash 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some gravel sections, and on one of them I locked out my
front fork because it's easier. Basically, turned off the suspension.
 Well, having been riding for like 3 hours, I forgot to unlock it and
went bombing down the ensuing downhill. On the downhill, there's a log
in the way, and I'd been fine bunny hopping it every other time.  But
when I landed, the suspension didn't absorb shock...instead sent it
right back at me, and it sent me flying through the air.  Realizing I
was in the air, I had a pretty cool moment, and thought about what I
should do.  "Tuck and roll" popped into my head, and that's exactly what
I did by lowering my shoulder into the trail below and rolling along.
 Turns out, this is the best way to crash, and I got up , saw no blood,
and kept right on going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the race, somewhere around 3hrs I think, it started pouring. Just
downpouring.  I got soaked to the  bone, which was fine, but my cell
phone I had left in the hammock probably wasn't as happy.  Nor was the
trail, which for real real sloppy, and the rocks on this very rocky
course, which protested by becoming extremely slippery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Crash 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the 3hr mark, I was one minute off finishing four laps, and figured I
should keep it up and go for nine laps. I'd get to finish the 9th lap if
I came in before the 6hr mark.  So, two laps later, on what was my 6th
lap, I was again bombing down the really rocky downhill.  Having seen
Mark Zhu crash on it right after it started raining, I had been pretty
intent on focusing on the trail.  But after 4.5hrs of riding at this
point, constantly monitoring the trail ahead for every root and rock, my
focus had dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd just lapped Cecil, and then before I knew it, the bike was gone from
underneath me and I was headed for the trail.  I didn't have time to
react, and the trail was really rocky = not a good combination.  I
landed hard on my leg and rolled onto my back, still attached to the
bike in one big clump of mud, person, and aluminum.  Cecil saw this and
stopped when I asked him if the bleeding gash on my leg needed stiches,
and being able to see the white fatty tissue underneath when I pulled it
apart, it seemed that I did.  After debating whether to head back up the
climb to the start/finish, since there weren't actually any paramedics
there, I decided to just take a really really easy lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma caught up, and we all rode together which actually turned out to be
a lot of fun!  After losing something like 30min on that lap (and
getting passed massively), I spent another 20min at the support area
cleaning out the mud and putting on some butterfly bandages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Moment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the adrenaline from the crash had long worn away, and I'd been
riding for &lt;em&gt;five hours&lt;/em&gt;, now bleeding, my body &lt;strong&gt;ached&lt;/strong&gt; and I was about
to throw in the towel.  On my slow 6th lap, and the time I'd been at
S/F, a bunch of people had passed.  I wandered over to the tent where
they we're keeping places, and looked that I was now in 7th, but not too
far behind.  One more guy came through for his 7th lap, and then
something clicked.  I said "I'm gonna go get him" and hopped on my bike
and sprinted off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hammered hard for the next 40min, and turned in my fastest lap time of
the day on lap 7.  Coming back through, I checked and have passed up to
3rd place overall.  Looking back, there was someone coming down the
trail behind me, so I took off without grabbing food or water.  It was
now 5:50 into the race, and I just had to hold off everyone behind me to
hold onto 3rd place.  2nd place was 15 out, so there was no catching
him.  My legs cramped on the long uphill, forcing me to stop and
stretch.  I'd look back and see below in the woods, and hop back on and
spin as hard as my legs would let me (pretty easy).  I took advantage of
my knowledge of the course and hopped off and ran the few really short,
really steep sections, and held my speed on the downhills.  On the
gravel, I opened up as much as I could, and by the time I was coming to
the end, had done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Post-race&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pretty much tipped over, and supporters brought me a cheeseburger and
beer, perfect!  I told Kirby that I was probably heading out to the ER
to get stiches, and as I was packing up, realized my phone had been left
in the rain.  Kirby said that he would do awards in like 10 min, so I
pulled up my car, and took my third place! Top three in each category
got to pick a prize from the table, and I got a seat which I desperately
needed.  The one I raced on was really crooked the whole time.  Kyle and
Brice won the Duo category, and Kyle got a tire that he needed (he'd
rode the finish of the race with a flat to hold a 1min lead) and Brice
got a bike cleaning kit (which we all desperately needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to go over to Stephanie's for dinner, but it was already
close to 9PM, I still had to go to the ER, and I was phone-less.  I sent
her an email, and a tweet to my parents when I stopped at home, and
headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turned out that my doctor was a huge cyclist, after the PA saw me and
said "Dr. ..., you have got to see this!" I was covered in thick mud,
including my face, and did have a nice gash.  We talked for awhile, I
actually felt a little bad for the other people in the ER.  The PA was
super super nice, and got my cut cleaned up.  Turned out that I didn't
actually need stiches, but I got it cleaned really really well and some
supplies to bandage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was on the phone with my parents, (apparently the "I'm fine"
prefacing my tweet is not sufficient to tell them I'm okay), Greg P
walked out of another room.  He had come up from his internship in NC
with Kevin and one of their other friends to do the MTB race, and
against him, the race had won.  He came in because he had some pretty
severe dehydration, and I wanna give some props to Kevin P for having
only ridden a mountain bike like twice, bringing a small, fully rigid,
commuter with v-brakes and finishing the race.  He was on a duo team
with the other guy (sorry, forgot his name), but still he manned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the funnier moments was when Kevin walked over to my tent area
with his bike before the race.  Immediately, all of us hardcore mountain
bikers had tools in our hands, and were surrounding his bike; taking off
reflectors, fixing his seat height, swapping out his pedals.  I let him
borrow my other pair of clipless shoes and pedals, since I was borrowing
James, and a VT jersey so he'd look legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dinner/Crash&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally able to get ahold of Stephanie with Paul's phone when I
got back home at 11, and she had actually waited! After I showered off,
and dropped off the other guy's gear at James' place, I went over to her
place for some delicious and much needed stuffed shells.  My Garmin told
me that I burned over 8,000 calories, which is probably high, but still
a lot.  After a long week, and a hard race, lots of food, I slept like a
baby once I got back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, my first endurance race was awesome.  I'm proud of my
"moment" to man up, and didn't get too injured really.  Although it's
been four days, and my right quad still had a nasty looking bruise. It's
actually getting worse.  That 12 mile run last night couldn't have
helped.  Anyways, that's all for now, I shall post pictures once they're
up!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Maturity: An inforgraphic</title><link href="/2011/07/26/maturity-an-inforgraphic/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-26T18:07:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-07-26T18:07:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-07-26:/2011/07/26/maturity-an-inforgraphic/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Will Paradis, I found this that I had made last year for his

&lt;h4&gt;Swim&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again a pool swim, although much more hectic than Christiansburg. At a
YMCA, the pool was 25 meters long, and we did a snake course through the
whole pool.  The biggest difference was the width of the lanes, which
was barely wide enough for two people (going opposite directions), which
made passing in the open very difficult.  I didn't actually pass anyone
at all.  Regardless, I survived this worst-of-leg of the triathlon, and
headed for my bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/me_swim.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/me_swim.jpg" title="me_swim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bike&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up for the triathlon the day before, I spent quite some time
making sure that the mats lining the long jog to the bike were straight,
and it was nice to not have to run like a drunk person to avoid hitting
the gravel barefoot.  I put my biking shoes and helmet on, and took off
running with my bike.  I also threw a spare tube and tire lever in my
back pocket, just in case I had a flat I could still finish the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third time is not the charm for getting on the bike correctly, as
Chad graciously shouted whilst I attempted to hop on the bike directly
in front of the mount line... but regardless I got going eventually.  It
felt infinitely better to be on my own bike, although it would've been
sweet to have bar end shifters again.  About a mile out, we crossed a
torn up road, and I made sure to bunny hop the sharp edge on the other
side.  You may wonder, did Andy leave his aero position for a mid-turn
bunny hop? The answer is a resounding no.  I didn't leave my aero
position the entire race except to shift and move my helmet up
periodically with my right hand.  And once I got in the drops to power
up a hill.  The course was very very gently rolling, and I felt like I
was going fast, but struggling with having the power on the crests, too
much running... Turns out my avg speed was a meager 22mph, but hey I'll
take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="280" caption="But not quite

&lt;p&gt;Coming into transition, I was again way too fast, and coming up to 20ft
from the dismount line at 20MPH after railing the corner wasn't ideal.
As I performed a reverse (right side) cyclocross dismount, I locked my
rear wheel and slid up the dismount line. Wish I had that on video, a
locked disc wheel dismount!  I didn't realize until after the race that
my disc wheel cover, which had been graciously loaned to me by Tyler
Gorney, had come unclipped in two places.  I'm hoping it was during the
skid, and not the race, but either way didn't matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting ready for the run felt like it took me forever, and the second
transistion was the part of my race that I am least happy with. We spend
many hours training for the sports, I should've spent 30min practicing
transition at some point. Grayson's transitions were together 1:36
faster than mine, and I would've been at exactly an hour. Chad
apparently yelled at me to stop lighting a campfire or something haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Run&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My legs were hurting on the bike, so I was worried about the run,
especially considering my past two experiences with running in
triathlons (both terrible).  But somehow, my legs felt strong as soon as
I got going (which, took a long time).  I put down the first mile at
sub-7 pace and was feeling great.  In fact, the only person who passed
me was doing a relay (they didn't swim or bike, so doesn't count).  He
was freakin hauling, and maybe I should've pushed myself to keep up.
Being conservative, I held my comfortable barely sub-7 pace for the
remainder, ramping it up for the finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Overall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished 3rd place in my age category, with a first in my age category
in the bike.  Overall, not as impressive, a 32nd overall with 20th
overall bike.  I just looked at female results, and unfortunately, I got
chicked as well (1 on the bike, 2 overall...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left my award in the Setup Events truck after tearing down, so Kevin
should be mailing it to me soon! It's a picture frame, and I'm hoping
that we get a picture from one of the photographers on course for free
to put in it? Not sure, hope there's a good pic if there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was tearing down, two noteworthy things happened.  I could hear
from the awards tent my number called, so I ran over there to see what
was up.  They were giving out door prizes I think, but I went up the guy
with the mic, and they gave me the mic, but I'm not sure what for.  I
didn't know what was going on, so I was about to start thanking my
friends and family for this great honor, but they realized I was working
the event and gave the prize to someone else.  Idk what it was haha.
 Also, Chad found a pair of white frame, black lense oakleys left in the
transition area.  They were in pretty rough shape, but unless someone
claims them, they're mine for now! Wore them to work today lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride back to BBurg was good (I drove the whole weekend) and Stefanie
got the gas so a big thanks to her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of Grayson laying down the fatest bike leg, and
Stefanie out on the run course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Part I: Finding a bicycle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my best finish in Wednesday Worlds to date (second!), my SRAM
Rival shifter broke as I crested Harding.  With the triathlon on Sunday,
and not actually being sure that was shifter was broken until I took it
to the shop on Friday, I had to scramble to find a bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the triathlon team has a bike that was donated to them that I
was cool to use.  So, I went over to their house and grabbed it Friday
night, and cleaned it up real nice (it was gross, took four rags to get
the grease off).  It wasn't until Saturday, however, that I went to put
my own pedals and seat on it.  And that's where the trouble was.  One of
the pedals was stripped out, and I couldn't get it off.  So, I took it
to East Coasters to see if they could.  And they couldn't.  Ran into
Christian at the bike shop and we gave it another shot at his house, to
no avail.  By this point, it was completely stripped.  I called Chrissy
and she said the pedals on it were no ones, so I went to Lowes and
bought some cobalt drill bits to drill out the pedal axle.  They're
supposed to go through hardened steel, but after an hour of drilling and
little progress, I gave that up.  Lucky again, Alex Brown had his
triathlon bike that I could use.  So I went on got that, and he even had
Zipp 404 wheels! Sweet.  After switching the pedals, and raising the
seat, I had a bike that would work.  Alex is tall, but not 6'4", so the
bike was too small but with racing wheels, it was a nice bike to borrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part II: Working PPU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SetUp Events puts on this triathlon series, and VT Tri Team has
connections with them get "comp entry." Basically, you work packet pick
up (PPU), set up for the race, or tear down and you get to race for
free. Sweet!  So Saturday I spent five or so hours handing out race
packets (goodie bags and numbers for the race).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part III: Waking up at 4:30AM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly the most difficult part of a sprint triathlon that starts
at 7AM.  I stumbled over to the race as early as I could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/early_morning.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/early_morning-225x300.jpg" title="early_morning"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part IV: Pre-race jitters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I ever get nervous before racing, but the VT Tri Team instilled
fear in hearts of our collegiate competition.  Everyone was in the pool
with five minutes until the swim, and the VT team got together and
chanted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hoki, Hoki, Hoki, Hy.&lt;br&gt;
Techs, Techs, V.P.I.&lt;br&gt;
Sola-Rex, Sola-Rah.&lt;br&gt;
Polytechs - Vir-gin-ia.&lt;br&gt;
Rae, Ri, V.P.I."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by a "let's go!!" then "hokies!!" a few times right up until
the race started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part V: The swim&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the least enjoyable part of any triathlon race,
I surprised myself by starting near the front and actually passing a few
people.  We all lined up on two sides of this huge pool, and were to
swim 8 down and backs of the 50 meter length.  The starts were every 10
seconds, so as soon the person in front of you goes, you hop in the
water and you're off before your goggles are adjusted.  At least in my
case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part VI: T1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of the water disoriented from a 400m swim, I stumbled to into
the transition area right behind Chrissy, who had started at the same
time as me on the other side of the pool.  She's right on my left:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/transistion.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/transistion-220x300.jpg" title="transistion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had my shoes and helmet on, I grabbed my bike off the rack.
 Since this is what I have been doing every single day for a year now
before class, my natural instinct was to hop on and ride away.  And
that's what I tried to do! It wasn't until I reached the chip timing pad
at the end of the area that I remember you aren't allowed to ride in
transistion, so I hopped off over the mat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mat, I hopped back on and started to sprint away again.  But,
again I was before the mount line, which is the red line spraypainted
directly in front of me in the picture below.  Also, take a chance to
notice the size of the bike:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/biking.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/biking-220x300.jpg" title="biking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part VII: Cycling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, time trialing on a tiny bike.  It took me a long
time, 2 miles or so, to catch my breath from the swim.  It also had
taken me a really long time to pass Chrissy, but I got her.  I was able
to pass quite a few people ( including Cortney :-P), but without any
indication of my speed, I felt like I was going pretty slow the whole
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part VIII: T2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only slightly less eventful than my first transition, it begins with a
steep downhill into a sharp corner between the cones leading into
transition.  As I performed a cyclocross dismount while front braking,
the rear wheel hopped off the ground naturally, but as it came back
down, there was a nasty metal clank.  After the race, I realized that
clank was from the wheel going back into the dropouts, because it was
loose!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part IX: Running&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of transition into the run involved a large set of stairs,
and with No Speak Americano blasting I had no choice but to bound by
those smarter races jogging up the stairs.  Announcer Cole Harden from
East Coasters said it right: "and it's Andy Reagan flying up the stairs
with those long legs, let's see if he can hold that pace." It wasn't
until I crossed the hill out of sight that it was apparent I could not
hold that pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cramped up worse than I ever had.  I tried running with my hands
behind my head to stretch it out and take deep breaths, but it was
really really painful.  It got so bad, that I actually had to walk a
little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/run_way_out.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/run_way_out-225x300.jpg" title="run_way_out"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortney passed me, then Chrissy.  They were both encouraging, and I was
actually shocked to hear that I'd made it a mile when Chrissy went by.
 I started to feel better and picked it up, and after she was 200m in
front of me, I was running again.  I spent the rest of the race chasing
her, and with the last hill approaching, I had her in my sights.  She
knew I was coming, and sprinted up the hill.  It was a long-ish little
hill, and I didn't see her again until the top, clasping her knees.  As
soon as I saw her I was shouting GOOO CHRISSY GOOOOO and she took off
again.  Apparently she had run up so fast, she had to throw up.  Nothing
like pushing your body that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the downhill and through the finish, I was close behind her and
was glad I was done running, I needed water.  Here I am trying to get
Chrissy before the last hill on the way back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/run_back.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/run_back-217x300.jpg" title="run_back"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part X: Post-race&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Kate and her husband Chris came out to support me at a 7AM race
which was great, although I was in no condition for hugs.  Being such a
local race, it was also cool to be able to watch the finish as people
that I know came across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even wikipedia made note of my radical facial hair, definitely read
this:&lt;/p&gt;

as well. I still need to write about a lot of things, but here's a
letter that I just sent to my representatives on behalf of
&lt;a href="http://peopleforbikes.org"&gt;peopleforbikes.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The design of our built environment has a profound effect on our lives.
Livable communities, those that support walking and biking as means of
transportation, are healthier and more enjoyable places to live. It is a
changes that we make before we are forced to make them that are the most
difficult, and before we are forced to move ourselves more healthily and
sustainably this is a decision that still has benefits today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support continuing, dedicated funding for bicycling and walking
programs in the next federal transportation bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cost-effective investments are important to our community, our
state, our nation and me. They cost less than 1.5 percent of annual
federal transportation spending but fund 12 percent of all trips that
Americans make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Americans made more than four billion bicycle trips. A record
number were commutes to work and other short trips that would have
otherwise been made by car. This significant shift to biking and walking
not only reduces road congestion and air pollution, it promotes active
lifestyles that make Americans healthier and saves governments money on
road and parking construction and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike and pedestrian projects and programs funded by Transportation
Enhancements, Safe Routes to School, and Recreational Trails provide
tremendous bang for each buck. In 2010, federal money supported more
than 3,000 of them. These same dollars would build no more than 20 miles
of new multi-lane highway in a single location. Bike projects are also
particularly good for creating jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal support is making bicycling and walking safer and providing
Americans with essential transportation choices. But we still have far
to go. We must not abandon this commitment now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to contact your Transportation or Environment and Public
Works Committee leaders to let them know that you support continuing,
dedicated funding for biking and walking. Please protect the biking and

of research have been going.  As I've mentioned before, I love my group
and it's awesome that a lot of them are into active things and cool
people.  Getting to know them all has been a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the first week and a half was somewhat slow, because I'm working
on the same project that I had been: building a discrete model of iron
metabolism.  This is something that I thought I had finished during the
semester, and was somewhat surprised when I learned that there were four
of that are going to spend a whole summer working on it.  We're going to
work on expanding it though, and perhaps revisit the ODE model.  So,
we've been learning about the biology involved in iron metabolism, and
how to build a discrete mathematical framework to describe this biology.
 Here is a brief overview of our goals from the &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ironmetabolism/home?pli=1"&gt;google
group&lt;/a&gt; that
&lt;a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~jchifman/"&gt;Julia Chifman&lt;/a&gt;, our research advisor,
has set up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Welcome to the Iron
metabolism Project!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Computational systems
biology has brought many new insights to cancer biology through the
quantitative analysis of molecular networks. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"&gt;The goal of this project
is to apply a systems biology approach to the understanding of
intracellular iron metabolism in normal breast epithelium and the
changes the network undergoes as cells transition to malignancy.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Our ultimate goal is to
identify key nodal points that may represent new therapeutic targets
in the future&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the core network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://2258292711817828768-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/ironmetabolism/home/iron_network_small-1.png?attachauth=ANoY7crnsDU2Oyb74otuyhsSz5RIoXeH_2jLqkOivkLZwZeuH6O33jS1xJLJ9HDWdOAS2Vn9NInXJ8tF5gPJn6VNeP5JMPtnn9kKOS5L02R7ugmnZ23FOwLjMBR911FCG5s3fTtxl7B2qaaS_OxrT2LWttM9o57YdSzsZTBxkN0avng8EU2P37o1LnFng-Xu5_4wMETMZ8u-6ObHsGYYFVNRsXxtetMN3X8qq0ec27fa5pqx7QxHul4%3D&amp;amp;attredirects=0" title="Iron Metabolism Core Network Cartoon"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning about those things, and personally gaining an even better
understanding of the biology, we learned about making truth tables. It
has been truly amazing how working with a group, explaining things, and
being able to dedicate  time to thinking through issues has really
deepened my understanding of modelling as a whole, the biology involved,
and how it comes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past Friday, Julia came to Blacksburg from MBI, and we set to work
on truth tables (the first step in building a mathematical model).  But,
we had problems, in that the tables we made did lead to networks that
had single components with one fixed point, which had been the goal.
 Jim, Emily, and I worked to fix the tables, by trying different effects
while Paul worked on a program to automate the process all Friday
afternoon, but we didn't get anything to really work out.  Over the
weekend, we didn't get a chance to work on it, but instead went over our
presentation for this week, which is supposed to always be on Monday but
it was pushed back to Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was really excited because long story short (omitting all of the
math and biology), I got the tables to work.  Paul was still
programming, and Emily and Jim had moved on to the ODE model after we'd
tried a few more things that didn't work.  What I ended up doing was to
throw out the algorithm that Reinhard had developed to make the
polynomials continuous, and instead do that part by hand for more
control in making the tables better reflect biology.  This led me to
making many tables, and after one (massively, I got 35 components when
we're trying for one, the most we've ever got) failed attempt, I even
surprised myself when my second try worked perfectly.  It's paining me a
little to not be able to explain the methods in text sentences, but
basically we're looking at the effect of a handful of protiens on the
Labile Iron Pool (an intracellular pool of loosely bound iron, available
to metabolism (which it needs to be, but too large of an amount is
reactive and harmful to cells, so it is tightly controlled...hence the
entire metabolic network to achieve this)), and using truth tables to
describe the effect that different combinations of the levels of these
protiens have on LIP.  But, we're not considering what LIP's current
state is, just using an algorithm to make the current state move
continuously to the new state, and this is the algorithm I tossed out by
adding LIP's current state as an input to it's future state directly,
and made the tables make more sense biologically, and it all worked out.
This means that the table has 81 entries, instead of 27, but it is
definitely better.  Now, Julia and I are going to see what Reinhard
thinks about all of this (which includes throwing out his own polynomial
algebra paper's algorithm because it doesn't make sense biologically
(according to me)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm excited, feeling like I've done some real research, and hope to
accomplish much much more in 9 more weeks!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Required Trash Service?</title><link href="/2011/06/13/required-trash-service/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-13T16:20:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-06-13T16:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-06-13:/2011/06/13/required-trash-service/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen the movie "No Impact Man"?

regular dude, who attempts to go a year without generating waste. As he

encourage and support this unsustainable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when the Town of Blacksburg requires me to pay for trash service, I
think that's not right, and a little unfair.  It's not too hard to get
down to throwing out only a grocery bag of trash every week, but there's
no incentive to do that.  It costs the fraternities down the street the
same amount to pile huge bags of aluminum cans (also perhaps the most
recyclable material around, saving about 95% of the energy by recycling)
as it would me for my meager grocery bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I understand some of the reasons that it is required, as I'm sure
some cheap college students would drive their pickup to a back road and
dump trash instead, or downtown could get gross looking....but hey,
guess I'm a dreamer. (or something).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Research Week 1, riding with CUS11</title><link href="/2011/06/03/research-week-1/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-03T19:41:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-06-03T19:41:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-06-03:/2011/06/03/research-week-1/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a great start to the week with a long night picking up Atsuya and

Emily from the airport late, a big shout out to Jeff for the company!
 During the day Tuesday, Betsy and I had driven to Roanoke to get a
first group, pick up bike parts for me, and then I took some of the guys
for a long run before dinner at Macados.  In retrospect, taking them up
the hardest, steepest climb in Blacksburg just because I felt like doing
it was probably not the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we got started with a meeting at the Inn at Virginia Tech,
including delicious breakfast.  From there, we got health and safety
training, and met with out mentor.  My group of Jim, Paul, and Emily
skyped with Julia Chifman, our mentor.  That was good, and not long so
not to be overwhelming on day 1, so we had the rest of the afternoon
off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday was our first real day, and Shernita presented to both her
group and ours about irom metabolism to avoid her and Julia giving the
same talk.  It was then up to our two groups to put together a
presentation for the following Monday about our research and what we
were planning on doing.  We were able to work really hard on the
presentation, so as not to have to do it over the weekend.  On Thursday
I also did a 9-mile run in the Vibrams, finishing with a 6 minute mile,
and rocked my arches hard.  The high speed really increased the force of
impact, and five days later after a long run today (6/7) they still hurt
a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday we hit the RU-ABLE high ropes course, and it was a blast. After
we got back, our groups presented what we had to Shernita, and that went
really well. Friday night we went out, but I slowed down after two
pitchers because I had an epic weekend in store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding to and from Charlottesville was certainly nothing less than epic,
covering a combined 167 miles, 15,500ft of climbing, and burning 18,000
calories riding.  I got a late start Saturday but that was not a problem
at all. The ride to Charlottesville was slightly shorter, a little less
hilly, and took 5.5 hours.  The ride back was hillier, with lots of
stops, and took a combined riding time of 14 hours.  It was awesome
getting to ride with Alyson, who led my trip, as well.  And she did the
whole route without much training, the hardest day on the entire XC trip
in my opinion, so props to her! I was glad to drive her partway back to
Cville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views and the riding were as incredible as I had remembered, the
people were fantastic, and I couldn't imagine a better weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Rafting, golfing, mowing, eating, riding, running, drinking, driving to Blacksburg</title><link href="/2011/05/31/rafting-golfing-mowing-eating-riding-running-drinking-driving-to-blacksburg/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-31T10:01:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-31T10:01:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-05-31:/2011/05/31/rafting-golfing-mowing-eating-riding-running-drinking-driving-to-blacksburg/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, the title pretty much covers what I've been up to since kayaking

&lt;h5&gt;Tuesday, May 24th&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, I got up early to mow the lawn so I'd have time to
get a new phone before going disc golfing.  I ended up getting the Droid
PRO, and so far (6/2) I love it.  Much faster than my old phone and the
blackberry keyboard is really nice.  And the batteries last two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got the phone, headed to Zdanowskis and we were off to play disc
golf. I drove, but it really only took 25min to get there, not as bad as
I remember.  After falling as much as three strokes behind, my
consistently gigantic drives overcame Dan and John, for a four-stroke
win on the day.  It was a gorgeous day out in Jamesville, and I actually
played the whole thing barefoot.  There were some dude playing that were
smoking and let us play on, it was funny when he told me "I've never
heard a barefoot dude turn down a hit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner, I ate some delicious blackened talapia that my Dad aand Mom
made, before going out for all you can eat wing night at Quaker Steak
and Lube.  I drove again, and it was cool seeing people there from high
school.  I didn't get all I could eat wings, but did eat an Atomic wing,
rated at 150,000 SHU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending about two hours deciding what we could all do together,
my Mom, Bro, and I set out to play some mini-golf and get me a bread
machine.  My Mom had one of those high school fundraiser discount cards,
and it's actually a good deal at Fairmont Glen, which is where we went.
 A single game pass is \$7, and a three game pass is \$14, and her
discount was
a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_one,_get_one_free"&gt;BOGO&lt;/a&gt; three game
pass.  So we got two three game passes, and a single game pass for the
price of three single game passes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.syracuse.com/entertainment/photo/9594022-large.jpg" title="Fairmount Glen"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the place to ourself, and its a really nice mini-golf place.
 It's in the middle of busy commercial Fairmont, but set down into a
quiet gully next to a stream.  Despite my Mom's four hole-in-ones, my
consistent twos and threes (my only scores) were enough for an 11-point
victory over Bro and Mom, who tied at 9 over par.   The "19th hole" is
this thing you putt into so they get the ball back, that is a ramp the
ball shoots off of, and it can go into the eyes, nose, mouth, or below a
clown's face entirely. The eyes are a 4-stroke deduction, the mouth
2-strokes, and the nose is a free pizza and free game.  My competition
swung away to no avail, and I used my superior patience and putt putt
skill to send the ball directly into the nose!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won a free game, pizza, bowling, an ice cream which I got right away
and was delicious, wings, and some other stuff that I can't even
remember.  Pretty sweet! From putt putt we went to Ra-Lins and got a
bread machine, which has by 6/2 made four delicious loafs of honey whole
wheat bread.  And on the way back we stopped for the free pizza, which
my brother, Mom, and I split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I talked my Mom into going running with me at the park, which
was great.  I beat up the soles of my feet wearing the Vibrams for 6
miles on cinder, but with some ice the feet were ready to go again.  It
was the first time that I got to use my new Garmin Forerunner 310XT, and
it's awesome.  Haven't had the slightest issue with it yet, which is soo
amazing after being used to troubleshooting the powertap.  It transfers
wirelessly to the computer, and auto-uploads the data, so after I finish
an activity and set the watch next to my computer, it's uploaded by the
time I'm done with a shower.  Here's the first run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Thursday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked my Mom into rafting the Ninemile Creek, an idea that I'd heard
about Kyle B, Tyler M, and Brian W attempting back in high school, and
didn't get to do with Sam and Dan.  Well, it was good that Sam, Dan, and
I stuck to Otisco Lake, because it was quite the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creek was barely navigable, with huge trees down every hundred feet
or so, making us portage our raft.  The whole trip covered 9 miles,
which brought us only to Marcellus Park, and took 7.5 hours. It wasn't
long before we ran into a huge pricker bush, and I got my arm all
scratched up, and we put a slow leak into the raft.  For a while, I
would stop and inflate every little bit just so we could keep going.
 Eventually, we found a metal fishing boat that had been washed up
ashore, and commandeered the vessel.  That allowed us to cruise on open
water, because in a deflated raft and little current, it was slow going.
 After many more miles, and the combined stubbornness of my Mom and I,
we portaged the boat again and again before finally making it to park.
 I was parched, and probably couldn't have gone too much farther without
water, on such a hot day. I'm glad that we did it, and it'll definitely
be an adventure to remember for my Mom and I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Saturday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuck around to maybe go up to Del's camp the next day, spend another
day with the Fam, and go out with Dan and Dan for the night. Also went

the logistical challenge of getting back to the cars to get the kayaks
after we were done, and Dan not understanding my solution of dropping
off bikes, we decided to just paddle around Otisco Lake.  Luckily Sam
had a kayak for Dan to use too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to leave, my brother couldn't find the keys to the Subaru
with the kayak on it, so I ended up taking the valet key. And, there was
no gas in the car so we had to fill up on the way.  But with all that
out of the way, we were headed over to Otisco Lake Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really made it interesting was the wind.  It was just another super
windy upstate NY day, but that also means big waves out on the lakes.
 The wind was strong enough yesterday to produce white-caps all across
the lake.  White caps are waves that break, like ocean waves, hence the
white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Dan and Sam had her kayaks that were short and wide = slow and
stable.  Mine was long and narrow = fast and unstable.  I learned
quickly that every ounce of speed gained by a narrow, long kayak meant
an equal loss in stability.  We got about 100 feet out, and as I was
shouting to Dan how to paddle...not paying attention to my own kayak, I
had been spun parallel with the waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="Imagine

&lt;p&gt;As I was still shouting to Dan, a big wave hit me from the side and
before I could finish the sentence I was underwater.  I used the paddle
to flip right back up, but I had taken on so much water from the
previous wave that I was immediately hit by another wave and back
underwater.  A swing of the paddle and I was back up, but another wave
before I could get a word out and I was underwater again.  It was kinda
fun, but after the kayak was entirely full of water, I bailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="351" caption="A little scary
knowing this thing was lurking
below"]&lt;img alt="" src="http://i141.photobucket.com/albums/r55/Smeltecca/musky.jpg" title="otisco_fish"&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of Sam and Dan, I floated/swam/hung-on-to-dans-kayak back
to shore, and dumped out the water.  Dan and Sam had also taken on some
water, and they drained their kayaks as well.  We set out toward the
spillway at the northern end of the lake, going with the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not more than a few hundred feet away, I needed to turn around a small
peninsula and in the process go parallel with the waves.  And before I
knew it, I was flipping over again.  The other two were a hundred or so
feet ahead, and I couldn't help just laughing as they looked back to see
me standing in waist-deep water next to the kayak again.  Since I could
touch, I dragged it to shore, and off we went again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two spills early, and I had learned how to handle the kayak in rough
water the hard way.  I didn't flip it again, nor did I let the boat get
sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching the spillway, Sam was thinking about going over it.&lt;/p&gt;

helmet, I'm glad she didn't (it's not this big
though)"]&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.arrowsmithwaterservice.ca/vimages/arrowsmith_dam_spillway.jpg" title="Spillway"&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we decided to attempt going back up the west shore.  I again
needed to dump water out of the kayak, and they took off.  In my sleeker
kayak though, I chased down the 200ft between in a matter of like one
minute.  As we got out into the waves, I was a few feet ahead, but
didn't dare looking behind me...if it threw me off balance for half a
second I would be underwater with these waves.  And to maintain a line
that was close to perpendicular, I had to paddle pretty hard.  And so I
kept going at it, trying to stay afloat, for awhile.  By the time I'd
found somewhere to pull off, I was exhausted.  I beached the boat on a
nice shoreline (the first one I'd got to).  It was someone's camp, and I
went to up and asked the dude up top if he minded if I hung out for a
few minutes on his deck.  He was cool, and I came back down to look for
my comprades.  But I couldn't see them at all.  I unloaded all the gear
from my kayak, remembering that I had taken the gatorade, score!  And I
explored the woods for a little while in my five fingers looking for a
place to pee, and found a cool waterfall actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, I looked out off the dock again, and could barely
make out two bobbing yellow dots...their paddles! I was glad to see
them, as I worried they had given up on this shore and headed back, but
they were coming.  However, they were a really long way away, into
strong waves and headwind.  So I laid out, put my bright kayak where it
was visible from the lake, and took a nap.  Eventually they made it in,
having been worried that I flipped or something along the way.  We all
took a rest, and decided how to cross the lake.  I had to take sharp
angles against the waves, or would take on too much water, so my choices
were to circumnavigate the whole lake, or take a diagonal across.  They
were slower, but could also go straight across in their kayaks.  So, I
set out to take the long way, and they went straight back to the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="385" caption="As I recall, the
waves were nearly this large!
(kidding)"]&lt;img alt="" src="http://amazingdata.com/mediadata21/Image/funny_amazing_cool_cute_surfer-wipeouts18200907221424301900.jpg" title="Wave"&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long haul, paddling hard the entire time on a long path
diagonally across the lake, but I kept my sights set on a nice patch of
shoreline.  Eventually I made it there, and went right onto the beach.
Rest!  I needed to dump the kayak again, and set off along the east
shore, with the waves and the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, going with the waves should have been easier, but boy was
that wrong.  I think that I was going much faster, but every time a wave
hit the back of my boat, it took all of my effort to not let it spin my
parallel with the wave.  Since I had some angle to the waves at my back,
they kept grabbing the back and trying to spin it.  So again I fought
really hard all the way back....and by the time I was approaching the
park, I was exhausted.  The other two were pulling their kayaks out, and
I saw Sam jump in for a swim.  By the time I rolled up they were both
headed back to the cars, but I went for a good dip in the water, it felt
amazing.  I'd gotten a great workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we loaded the kayaks I found a dry shirt for Dan and it was off to
Subway! Footlong chicken terriyaki never tasted so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.webanswers.com/post-images/2/20/10382A1E-1605-852D-B4DB11A3012E8D0E.jpg" title="Subway"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at Dan's I couldn't convince Sam to come trail running with me in
her matching &lt;a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2316/2345080258_2bdb6bf081.jpg"&gt;five
fingers&lt;/a&gt;,
she had to get back to Buffalo that night. Bummer.  It wasn't until I
went outside though until I realized I'd locked the valet key in the
car.  Crap.  Barefoot, I jogged back home, thinking that Kyle would have
found the other key by then, and I'd go back and get the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hadn't found it yet though, and I accidentally threw the Zdanowskis
for a loop.  They saw me leave their house, but 5 minutes later noticed
my car was still there...and I wasn't answering my cell phone (it was in
the car!) They thought that maybe I had been kidnapped! Eventually I
called AAA to get the car unlocked, and they were supposed to give me
5min notice before they got there.  But the dude only called me when he
was at their house, so I sprinted down there (barefoot!) and caught him
as he was finishing up. Before I got there though, Mrs. Zdanowski came
outside to see a guy breaking into my car, and still had no idea what
had happened to me. The AAA dude told her that "he locked his keys in
the car..." though and we were all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.buzzle.com/img/articleImages/513024-26013-5.jpg" title="Keys in car"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a crazy day!! It was a lot of fun, and today my goals are: mow
lawn, trail run with my new Garmin watch that should be showing up,
finish my spring research summary (check!), go get the Droid Pro so I'll
have a reliable cell, disc golfing with Zdan at 3, and then Quaker Steak
and Lube with a bunch of ppl for dinner!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tour de Syracuse</title><link href="/2011/05/23/tour-de-syracuse/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-23T10:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-23T10:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-05-23:/2011/05/23/tour-de-syracuse/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing only the criterium race on Saturday, and it was a ton

of fun.  I went down to Onondaga Park in Syracuse a few hours early, in
time to catch Anna finishing third in her crit.  Here's how it went
down.  If you're going to read this, gotta play this in the background
(it'll make sense in the
end): &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYH_R6bx9-w&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYH_R6bx9-w&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful, warm, sunny day and I went for a good 15 minute ride
around the Strathmore area of Syracuse before coming back to pin my
number on and get to the start line.  That is a beautiful area of
Syracuse, huge perfectly-manicured houses with a view of the skyscrapers
just a mile below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went over to registration to grab some pins, and while I was in the
tent, they called my name over the loudspeaker to come to registration.
 Well, beat them there.  They said that I was not eligible to race in
the Cat 4 which race which I had registered for, because I was still a
Cat 5.  Turned out that online I'm still showing up as a Category 5,
when I should be a Category 4 after I was approved for my upgrade.
 Thanks to DROID I was able to pull up the approved upgrade email, and
the guys at registration pinned my number on since the race was going to
start soon.  I went up onto the stage at the finish line and showed them
my email, they pulled up my info on line, and got it all sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, it was a good chance to cool down instead of finishing
warming up before the start of the race. It was by far the biggest field
of the day, with over 50 riders, and I made sure to line up in the front
row.  Just as we were about to go, I caught my dad waving behind the
group, and was glad that my parents had made it for the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as they said "GO!" I was clipped in and moving, and some dude in
a red skinsuit next to me had sprinted off the line.  I assumed that it
was going to be a fast start, and sprinted after him.  To my surprise,
when I looked back and expected to have the whole field on my wheel as I
caught him, there was no one at all.  The entire group was a couple
hundred feet behind us, and this guy in red was crushing it.  I stuck on
him, my cold legs complaining furiously, but I told them to shut up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were crushing, but still I had expected that we would be quickly
pulled in after the first of 22, 1-mile laps.  Again, our lead had grown
to be huge, and we were pulling away.  I didn't want to kill myself
since the course was so long, there was no hope for lapping the field
and little hope of riding for an hour out front, but still pulled
through pretty hard.  I didn't hear it, but my dad said that I got a
sweet shout-out over the loud speaker as Andy Reagan from Virginia Tech
pulled away from the group.  We rode out front for like 3.5 laps before
getting reeled in, and I sat in the group for what must've been 5 more
to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was somewhat tight, not really tight but with such a huge
group, there wasn't any room to move up.  When the first wave of primes
came, I wanted to go, but there was just no making through the group to
the front.  As the lap count shrunk, I moved up near the front, and was
in the action for a few primes just to hold the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two laps to go, I fought harder to stay up front, and coming into
the last lap had perfect position, 5th wheel.  But as we approached the
line all the dudes in front of me disappeared, and I was on the front.
 Not good position.  So I pulled hard through the line, through the
first corner, and then attacked off the front.  Not good move.  But, I
went for it.  Opened a small gap, but with close to a mile until the
finish.  I went as hard as I could, but my legs cracked as I tried to
hold off a field that had been resting on my wheel.  So, they all passed
me.  And I rolled through the finish near the back, unable to summon a
second effort on the uphill to move up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I made some strong moves, and felt confident in my
ability to race Cat 4.  I didn't finish as well as I would have liked,
but on a race like this, I really needed a team and to race smart....but
racing smart ain't no fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the race I was able to catch up with the dude I'd rode out front
with, and some of the other guys I was riding with in the group.  I'd
seen Emily Garrant there before the race, but forgot that she had said
her bf was racing Cat 5 right after until I was halfway home.  Perhaps
the highlight was walking back to my car, and a guy from WVU was on his
trainer blasting the techno remix to Country Roads that we heard every
race this spring from their van.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Being Home and Training</title><link href="/2011/05/20/being-home-and-training/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-20T10:31:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-05-20T10:31:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-05-20:/2011/05/20/being-home-and-training/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been home for almost two weeks now, and have actually been getting

I'm leaning toward entering the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnium"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; (crit, RR, and TT). To
make up for a lack of pix, I've included lots of links!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Monday's Ride&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up earlier than I think I have all break to meet Anna Young, who I
met at &lt;a href="http://syracusebicycle.com/"&gt;Syracuse Bicycle&lt;/a&gt;, to go on a ride
around the &lt;a href="http://tourdesyracuse.com/"&gt;Tour de Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; road race
course.  It was raining, and there was no way I would've been going out
for a ride myself.  After getting lost on the way there, and finally
finding my way thanks to Droid, we ended up riding for about two hours
and 35 miles.  The rain ligthened up during our ride, and still when it
was raining hard, my &lt;a href="http://www.showerspass.com/catalog/men/mens-jackets/mens-club-pro-jacket"&gt;Shower's Pass
jacket&lt;/a&gt;
kept me warm in the 50deg temps.  The ride was fun, we got lost a couple
times, but managed to find the race course.  It's hilly.  After lap 1
Anna was cold, so we didn't do a second lap, but climbed &lt;a href="http://www.songmountain.com/"&gt;Song
Mt&lt;/a&gt; for a second time before calling it a
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again it was raining, and I was planning on going up to the &lt;a href="http://onondagacyclingclub.org/"&gt;Onondaga
Cycling Club&lt;/a&gt;'s Tuesday Night Time
Trial that they put on every Tuesday. But with the weather, and the 40
minute drive, I didn't feel like going all the way up to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=north+syracuse&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=North+Syracuse,+Onondaga,+New+York&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;z=14"&gt;North
Syracuse&lt;/a&gt;
for a 10 mile ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I went down to the park and ran for just over an hour.  I felt great
running, and could've gone even longer.  Highlights of the run included
showing off to the kids playing basketball by &lt;a href="http://theswamp51.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dwighthowardsupermandunk.jpg"&gt;throwing one
down&lt;/a&gt;
as a I ran by, then lifting up a really little kid so he could &lt;a href="http://www.reeec.illinois.edu/images/fulbright/2007/week2/BBallKidDunk.jpg"&gt;put one
in&lt;/a&gt;,
and near the end of the run saving a &lt;a href="http://www.lvmvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/snapper_megan.jpg"&gt;gigantic snapping
turtle&lt;/a&gt;
from getting ran over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sleeping in and starting the
&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Medieval_baker.jpg"&gt;breadmaker&lt;/a&gt;,
I headed out for a long ride. I wasn't sure where I was going, but
meandered my way over to
&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=manlius+ny&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Manlius,+Onondaga,+New+York&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;z=13"&gt;Manlius&lt;/a&gt;
to use the \$25 gift certificate I won for &lt;a href="http://bikeloft.com/"&gt;Bike Loft
East&lt;/a&gt;.  I picked up a neat little
&lt;a href="http://media.rei.com/media/718804_9996Lrg.jpg"&gt;multi-tool&lt;/a&gt; and a couple
&lt;a href="http://shop.honeystinger.com/products/Honey-Organic-Stinger-Waffle.html"&gt;honey stinger
waffles&lt;/a&gt;
that I've heard good things about.  Since I'd ridden close to 30 miles
and forgot to bring food, the stinger waffles were delicious and fueled
me home.  The guys at the shop gave me an alternate route to taking 173
all the way home, and it was a beautiful ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right as I had left, it started misting, but during parts of my ride it
cleared up, and by the end it was an awesome day out.  I went all the
way over to route 20, probably close to 70MPH down it
from&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Lafayette,+NY&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=LaFayette,+Onondaga,+New+York&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;z=14"&gt;Lafayette&lt;/a&gt;,
and then was going to come back to hit Cedarvale so I didn't have to
take East Seneca Turnpike.  But, I was unsure if the left turns that I
saw were right, so I didn't take any of them and ended up back in the
valley after all that work.  I didn't mind though, and went up the big
hill out of the valley, and was going to take Cedarvale down the curves
and into &lt;a href="http://marcellusny.com/"&gt;Marcellus&lt;/a&gt;, then come back up the
Turnpike, but Del called me wanting to run, so I headed straight back on
the turnpike.  Here's a map of the ride (from my
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/andyreagan"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had time to make an awesomely huge PBJ
(&lt;a href="http://t.co/SC88plf" title="http://twitpic.com/4zdmdw"&gt;http://t.co/SC88pl&lt;/a&gt;)
and then Del and I went on a pretty fast run.  I didn't realize Del was
such a runner, and for some reason I was going really fast in the
beginning to see what he had.   Pretty sure that after my ride, I was
hurting more than he was at high pace, so we relaxed and went for a
friendly jog.  Here's our run:

&lt;h5&gt;Thursday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My legs definitely needed a rest, and they got  it Thursday.  I didn't
do jack s***.  Although I did manage to plow through &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307266303"&gt;Born to
Run&lt;/a&gt;
by Christopher McDougall, &lt;a href="http://www.americanconsumernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/lawn.jpg"&gt;mow the
lawn&lt;/a&gt;,
help my Dad take back an elliptical to &lt;a href="http://www.sportsauthority.com/"&gt;Sports
Authority&lt;/a&gt;, and get a sweet new watch
out of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book was awesome, coming recommended to me by Bill Bell, and I would
highly encourage others to read it.  It's a great story.  If you're a
runner or not, I can't imagine that after reading you won't want to run
barefoot through the woods. Okay, maybe not barefoot, or in the woods,
but "pounding the pavement" is definitely not what you'll learn running
is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New watch: we'd had the elliptical for over a month, so they gave us
store credit on the return.  We used a little bit to pick up resistance
bands that my dad needed and a yoga mat for me.  I'm not the impulse
buyer at all, as opposed to my Dad who definitely is.  Looking at GPS
watches they had there for running his strategy was "try and return" but
I wanted to research more.  And I think he wanted to get me a pair of
basketball shoes, but for the amount I play...the lack of tread on mine
isn't that big of a deal.  Anyway, when we got home, I was super eager
to research watches online to help spend his store credit.  But first, I
had to knock down half of the lawn and pick my stuff up around the
house.  So, after looking around online, I naturally settled on the
nicest watch that Garmin makes.  It'll be awesome to run with, on trails
and everywhere, and it's made to snap right on the bike too.  And Sports
Authority carried it online...done deal.  Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Friday (today)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's already 11:30, but I hope to sneak in an opener workout and work on
a write-up of my research from this semester, which I've been
procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! Other news: I got a 3.60 on the semester!! I'm very pleased with
this result, scoring an A- in Advanced Calculus, A in Numerical
Analysis, a B in Number Theory, and an A- in C++.  I'm
only disappointed with the C++, but eh not too bad really.  My
cumulative GPA is currently a 3.64.  The real test of my entire
undergraduate awaits...real analysis in the fall. And hopefully I should
be hearing back about the &lt;a href="http://www.math.vt.edu/ugAccel.php"&gt;BS/MS
program&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

into doing this race that raises money for
&lt;a href="http://www.amberations.org/"&gt;Amberations&lt;/a&gt;, and that first year I got a
flat.  Having raced three seasons of collegiate cycling with &lt;a href="http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu/"&gt;Virginia
Tech&lt;/a&gt;, I've gained some fitness over the
years. And I've learned that going out to the bars and getting 4hrs of
sleep for 2 nights before races is very beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_5705.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_5705-e1305496656484-176x300.jpg" title="IMG_5705"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pouring rain for the whole race, which was actually pretty short,
only taking a total of 50:11. At the start, I went hard on the front
hoping to lose anyone that shouldn't be there, and succeeded well, as
the group had somehow splintered to 5. The real challenge of the course
which circles Otisco Lake is the short, steep climb on Churchill Rd.
 The roads takes a 150 degree turn, and then its 20% grade for .2 miles.
 Doesn't sound long, but that part is freaking steep.  It continues
upward at a sligthly more reasonable grade for another half mile or so,
then it's downhill (plus a few rollers) to the finish.  When we hit the
hill, I took off, and was about two minutes ahead of the next guy at the
top where my fan crew was stationed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I knew I had a pretty big lead, I crushed it even harder for the
remainder of the race, all the while hoping to open enough of a lead to
have time to change a flat, since that's the only way I wasn't winning
now.  As I approached the finish line, there was no one in sight so I
eased up a little for my final sprint.  Since I had been by myself, I'd
been throwing down some attacks against myself earlier.  I came within
sight of the line, and opened it up for my self-lead out.  I then pulled
off of myself lead-out man and sprinted through the line, sprinting away
from the invisible peleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race organizer was on her way to the finish line to tell the timers
that they should expect finishers in 5-10 minutes, so it sounds like I
opened a course record in a downpour! It was three or four minutes
before the next guy came through. :-P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trophy is pretty sweet, and I got some cool schwag, including a
t-shirt from and \$25 to &lt;a href="http://bikeloft.com/"&gt;Bike Loft East&lt;/a&gt;, 6 ice
creams at &lt;a href="http://www.carvelnorthsyracuse.com"&gt;Carvel North Syracuse&lt;/a&gt;, 6
games of bowling at &lt;a href="http://amfcenters.com/strikensparelanesny"&gt;AMF Strike 'N Spare
Lanes&lt;/a&gt;, and a water bottle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether it was a lot of fun, and I feel accomplished to have won the
same race that had been my first.  I recommend this ride/race to
everyone! I'll see if I can get my Mom to do it next year, after I
successfully transform her into an age-group-dominating triathlete...

Del's 21st birthday at SU, so I could get back in time to run a race.
 My Mom probably thought she was getting out of it when I wasn't home
till 8, but as soon as I got in the door I grabbed my running clothes
and a slice of toast for breakfast and we were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The run was at the NYS Fairgrounds, and we got there in plenty of time.
 Too much time really, as we had an hour to burn before the race started
and just meandered around the crowds.  There were 2000 runners, and at
least twice that many walkers, not to mention spectators.  First, the
wheeled entrants were off, which included our neighbor Mrs. Turner on a
wheelchair with a broken foot.  Then, Julie Bohiem gave the rest of us
the "go!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most crazy huge charity runs, the first mile was slow with weaving
through the crowds while trying to maintain a decent pace.  They line up
the crowd in order of expected mile time, but that hardly works...we
started pretty close to the 6 minute mile line and there were plenty
people ahead of us that would have fared better at the 10 minute mile
line.  Nevertheless, we came through mile 1 with a time of 8:02 which
wasn't great but then kicked it up a notch.  Mom's Nike+ watch had us at
or under 7min/mile for the next mile! At the second mile marker, it had
thinned out, and as I had hoped we caught the 10 year old kid who flew
by us in the first mile.  From there, I think we were both pretty tired
and fought to run closer to 7:30 pace for the last mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom surprised me a little with a fast sprint for the finish, and the
timers had her in 1 second ahead of me, at 23:44.  Not the greatest
time, but we had enjoyed the run and it was good enough to put my Mom at
3rd place in her age category!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the race I decided that I really did need a pair of running
shorts, my heavy and cumbersome basketball shorts were definitely what
was holding us both back.  We were already planning to go back to
Syracuse Bicycle to get a new tire for Dad's bike (the one I got the day
before didn't fit), and after that we went to Fleet Feet and I finally
got some running shorts.  I'd like to take a sentence to say I'm sorry
to hard-earned biking tan lines, as they may begin to fade after years
of dedicated lining up the bike shorts with the tan line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the tire, it was really strange that it didn't fit.  I got a 26
by 1 and 1/2 inch tire, and Dad's wheel is a 26 inch wheel.  But, the
tire was way too big.  As it turned out, there is a difference between 1
1/2 width and 1.5 width...the 1 1/2 is for a specific Schwinn wheel.  We
got a 1.5, and I just put it on a little bit ago and we took the bike
for a spin up and down the street a few times.  Once I figure a way to
raise Dad's handlebars a little bit more, he'll be all set to dominate
the NYS Rail Trail system.  I also attempted to get my Mom to get a road
bike while we were there, to turn her into a triathlete, and she might
actually get one... she's a strong swimmer already so I think she could
do well in tri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, my finicky powertap which didn't work again on my 43mi
ride Wednesday
&lt;a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/34061572/"&gt;(http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/34061572/&lt;/a&gt;),
was unable to be troubleshot at Syracuse Bicycle yesterday, and today I
think that I may have found the problem.  A little frustrated with it, I
was taking off the mount and discovered a big rip in the cable that had
been hidden underneath some electrical tape, so hopefully when I get
back to BBurg and try a new mount, it'll fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, I'm waiting on peeps to come over for a little bbq for Del's
birthday, then we're going out downtown again to celebrate.  I've
offered to DD this time, as I again will be up early, for a bicycle race
this time. Registration at 8AM and the race goes off at 9AM.  Here is
the race: &lt;a href="http://www.amberations.org/pages/BR2011.shtml"&gt;http://www.amberations.org/pages/BR2011.shtml&lt;/a&gt;.  It should be
fun, and I'm looking forward to it despite the fact it's going to be
raining.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Home!

want to do it again.  But it's good to be home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night I got home, my Mom told me that she's found a 5k on Saturday,
and a bike race on Sunday for me to do! So I need to start training
apparently, and today I went for a bike ride and a trail run.  I went
and rode the steepest hills I could find, to prepare for the bike race
which goes up the steepest road I've ever ridden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bike-ride.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bike-ride-300x180.png" title="bike ride"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I turned onto Pleasant Valley Rd, there was a huge sign saying "Road
Closed 2 Miles" and I assumed it was construction so I didn't even
hesitate.  Riding along the "disappearing lake" in the valley, it was
higher than I've ever seen it, all the way right up to the road.
 Apparently, last month Syracuse had the wettest month on record, and
that was visible there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple miles, there were some cars pulled over, backing up the
wrong side of the road, and it was like wth is going on here.  As I
crested a small hill, I saw why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2271" align="aligncenter" width="224"
caption="Pleasant Valley
Rd"]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_20110510_115257.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_20110510_115257-e1305127183609-224x300.jpg" title="IMG_20110510_115257"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rolled down to the edge of the water, passing all of the suburbans
that were turning around.  A lady driving one told me that she had seen
some big trucks just go through, and it was up to their doors.  She was
basically telling me that I better turn around on my skinny tired road
bike, considering she wasn't even going to try in her unnecessarily
large vehicle.  I thought "weak" and pedaled into the lake.  My only
concern was drowning my powertap wheel, but it's supposed to be water
resistant.  As I rode further in, it got deeper, and my entire
drivetrain was underwater, my feet only emerging from the water at the
top of my pedalstroke.  As I neared the end and the water, shallowed, I
stood up and sprinted out of it. Chyeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on Pleasant Valley Rd, I felt pretty accomplished by cruising by a
tractor with three huge tillers in tow, but that's probably not too
impressive, his top speed is like 15MPH.  After that, I cruised up the
13 curves, rode around the high school, up Falls from the very bottom
(super steep climb) and beat a lift truck to the top!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>le Tour de Franzia</title><link href="/2011/04/28/le-tour-de-franzia/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-28T18:46:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-28T18:46:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-04-28:/2011/04/28/le-tour-de-franzia/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/le-Tour-de-Franzia.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/le-Tour-de-Franzia-300x300.jpg" title="le Tour de Franzia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Chyeah.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/le-Tour-de-Franzia.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/le-Tour-de-Franzia-300x300.jpg" title="le Tour de Franzia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Chyeah.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Random thoughts</title><link href="/2011/04/28/gary-v-vt-random-thoughts/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-28T01:37:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-28T01:37:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-04-28:/2011/04/28/gary-v-vt-random-thoughts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I went to the presentation by Gary V at Burruss Auditorium,

after watching the whole event come together on twitter with John Boyer
(the Plaid Avenger). I wasn't sure what to expect, I mainly knew he was
a wine guy, but he gave a really amazing presentation
about entrepreneurship with some even more amazing give aways at the
end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things he gave away (besides 2 super bowl tickets, 10's of
thousands in gift cards, trip for 4 to LA for 3 nights, a weekend in NYC
and Jets game with him, 2 JOBS, etc) was \$10,000 toward a new startup.
 That one really got me thinking, what would I start.  One of the big
points of his presentation was that ideas were not important, but it was
being able to deliver on those ideas that matters.  So what if someone
else thought of it too, if you're the one that can make it happen.  To
me, this becomes: how would I make the world better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize that this gets pretty rambly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple years, I've become extremely interested in
transportation.  Since getting on the cycling team, and experiencing the
freedom and convenience of biking, transportation has become really
important to me.  When I'm not searching for congruent numbers (the area
of rational primitive pythagorean triples that I was looking at
tonight), or learning 1000 different programming languages, I often
think about the bicycle.  My thoughts are wide and varied.  And I've
written about it a little, but not a whole lot.  On the Virginia Tech
Cycling Team, and with Bike and Build, I've done things that most people
couldn't imagine on bicycle.  Riding cross country seemed pretty easy,
and climbing mountains, racing at extremely high speeds are things that
I think that I may take for granted that my body just does.  Last night
everyone at homebrew was amazed as I was demolishing some food, but am
still skinny.  Well, I was the only one who biked the two miles there.
And I swam for 1.5hrs before that...there ya go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Gardner and I have talked about starting a bicycle advocacy group.
 But what are most bicycle advocacy groups doing? Advocating for bike
safety, rather than advocating for people to ride bikes? I hope not.
 Why is bicycling deemed alternative transportation? Around town, it's
without a doubt my primary means of transportation.  I think that our
verbiage is important, and overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary V opened tonight talking about how scary it is to drive anywhere
now, and heck, the leading cause of death for my age bracket is car
collision. F the word "accident".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to hate cars. Really. They're dangerous, without a doubt, and
on the roads it's not bicycling that's dangerous but often the cars.
 Bike Snob NYC suggested that perhaps if we were to make bikes into
fearsome machines, destroying what lays in their path, that maybe we
would dedicate more road space to them.  I find myself being mad at
buses around campus, and how if I ever rode one, I would feel like the
laziest person in the world.  I saw one today spew a 20ft column of
solid black exhaust, which I had to breath in, and was tempted to make a
photo project out of capturing that  But then, when I need to go
somewhere outside of town...like home in NY, I'm behind the wheel of my
personal automobile.  Also easy to take for granted that everyone has
cars.  Heck, it's sometimes pretty convienent to have one...or wait, is
it? I just said biking was more convenient two paragraphs ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I love about bikes are working on them.  I can't
draw the steel for the tubing, but I can pretty well assemble the parts
of a bicycle.  Riding a fixie really exemplifies the simplicity of it,
there's not much to the bike, not too many parts.  I've built wheels,
welded parts of  a trike together, and heck maybe next I'll braze tubing
together.  Working with things like that, and riding a bike that you've
assembled are awesome because the quality of the job is self-evident.
 If your rear derailer isn't shifting properly, well then it's that way
because you made it that way, and you have to be in tune with the
machinery to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've thought more about how we as a society think we're pretty
advanced.  In college, in engineering and such, it's pretty easy to get
the impression that we got all this shit figured out.  But on a larger
scale, we're still fighting and killing each other. Fighting wars.
Extreme poverty and lack of education are problems we hear about, but
tough to imagine for me because I've been a student my entire life.  And
coming back to transportation.  Logic certainly does not prevail.  If it
was, I imagine we would design our built environment very differently.
 But heck, how do I know what would be best.  Sometimes I think about
what it would be like if they drew like a 3 mile wide circle around
town, built some parking garages on the outside of it, and then the only
way to get around on the inside was by human power.  Or if they turned
the drillfield into cycling only...it would certainly be easier to bike
around it, without having to navigate around the buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I've written a 3am post like this before, but just not posted it.
If you're reading this...well I didn't hold back, despite the fact that
most of these thoughts are incomplete.  And on paper (lcd), I think it's
hard to picture what I'm saying in a broader sense, how everything is so
connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I rode home from a couple hours of programming at the VBI, and I
think there was a tornado advisory out.  Either way, it was really
raining hard.  Most people would think of how terrible it would be to
bike home in the pouring rain, but really it's just a two mile ride.
 Sure, I got soaked, but I think a lot of people need to HTFU.  I take
it a little extreme, when blood running down my leg while mountain
biking just really doesn't phase me and it got down to like 35 this
winter in my room...some things that I don't think most people could
fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hope no one read this!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Only two weeks of school left!</title><link href="/2011/04/25/the-end-of-cycling-season-and-only-two-weeks-of-school-left/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-25T20:49:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-04-25T20:49:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-04-25:/2011/04/25/the-end-of-cycling-season-and-only-two-weeks-of-school-left/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been awhile since I posted, my b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Friday: HW, Test, then driving!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a tough week of schoolwork, among other things school-related
(applying to grad school...the usual) and finished up Friday.  First,
with turning in my Number Theory problem set on which I was able to
figure out the two really hard problems and finish up my C++ program in
the morning.  And I took my second exam in Advanced Calculus, which I
think went pretty well.  I studied for it as much as I though was
reasonable, which probably amount to two or so hours...because all there
really is to do studying is memorize definitions (4 pages of them) which
I know by now already, and go over the homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping back in time to Thursday, I had a C++ exam and I'm pretty sure I
crushed it.  I was disappointed with my performance on the first test,
probably because I didn't really study and the questions were just picky
about the syntax.  But now that we're into more complicated programming,
I like it better.  Last time I didn't do any of the Koofers, but this
time I did three of them and it was getting pretty repetitive.  On
Tuesdays and Thursdays this semester I have been eating with the Tri
team for lunch at D2, but they were on their way to Nationals in Alabama
already so it was just Andy W and I.  Just saw Grayson in the parking
lot as we got back from the races, and it sounded like they did really
well, 8th overall, so congrats to them!  So my day Thursday was like:
wake up, C++ koofer, Num Anal class, lunch, study C++ for three hours
and work on a prime number program, C++ test, then coding for another
two hours before I gave it up and went to PK's for dinner with the
cycling team guys.  One of the problems for number theory was to write a
program to determine whether a given really really large number was
prime.  I would do it in MATLAB, but it can only factor numbers up to
2\^32 (even though I'm running the 64 bit version) so I tried to learn
Mathematica which can factor numbers that big.  But programming in
Mathematica is super confusing, and totally unlike any other language.
 It's stupid.  So I resorted to C++, and the program I wrote was like
400 lines of code, and there is still more I need to add to make it work
fully.  A lot of that is a function that factors big numbers, then
another one that takes bases to giant exponents in binary...and you
don't care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to attempt an easy ride Friday, but didn't get a chance to
before I needed to pack up, and have time to submit my beer for
competition before leaving at 4.  I submitted my IPA with just cascade
hops that Will and I brewed under "American IPA" and my Raison D'Etre
clone under "Belgian Dubbel" and I think that my belgian has a good shot
at it.  The IPA...I'm just hoping that it's at least carbonated by the
time they judge them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to WV is long, but we split it half and half (2.5 hrs each)
with a stop at Pies and Pints, an awesome pizza place in Fayetteville,
WV.  The black bean pizza that Jacob and I split was delicious, but
Rogue's Chateau beer was an imperial porter, but too harsh on the
roastedness.  The chocolate malt made it taste really burnt. Oh well on
that.  At the hotel for the night we hung out, and drank some Yuenglings
before calling it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday: Double Criterium&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criterium course in downtown Clarksburg is an awesome venue, with
the race going around two city blocks in the middle of downtown.  The
mayor loves having us out, and there are all sorts of activities with a
kids race, people in costumes, and a cop on 10 foot stilts was walking
around.  I even saw the mayor, who came up and introduced herself to all
of us, riding around on a trike in the open area in the middle of the
course where the kids stuff was going on too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2223" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;We didn't have anyone in the first race, Men's D, but there were five of
us ready to get Andy W the win in the Men's C.  The race was 30 min, and
it was a fast race, mostly due to Jake.  He was up front most of the
race, put in two attacks, and made us all work.  I attacked at some
point, and got off the front, but App State weren't the ones chasing me
so I eased off.  Coming down to the last lap, Andy W and I were not in
great position at all.  He got on my wheel into the last lap, and as we
came around the start/finish I drilled it with him behind me and we got
up near the front into turn one.  I pulled at something like 1200W, and
on that stretch blew myself up.  Coming out of turn 2 into the slight
uphill, I was cooked and wasn't able to communicate that to Andy who
stayed behind me for too long.  App went around me to the left, and Andy
was left to chase them into the last two corners, and to the finish
line.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have gone too hard on that first pull,
and saved enough to give Andy a real lead out, or at least let him know
that I was dead.  So I pretty much screwed the pooch on that one...and
it was a frustrating finish.  I think Andy got like 4th or something,
but he needs wins to move up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the collegiate races, there were also USAC category races going
on.  By USAC races, I just mean non-collegiate races.  Technically our
collegiate races are part of USAC, but we race in the collegiate
categories of A through D.  That's unique to collegiate, and all the
other races across the country have categories 1 through 5. And pro,
which is above 1 I guess. But 1's and A's are the fastest, and down from
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2221" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;On my license, I'm still a cat 5 (beginner), and so Jake, Christian and
I decided to race the cat 5 race.  The guy from WVU organizing the races
offered the collegiate guys a discount to \$15 for a second race of the
day, which was cool.  The race was 30min, same length as Men's C.  It
ended up being mostly a collegiate rematch too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2220" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;There were three prime laps (pronounced preem), which are laps in which
the first person wins something.  In collegiate, every race that I've
done for that matter, the primes are for more points.  Which is
exciting, but not really.  Perhaps the coolest part of real racing is
that there are real prizes.  So for the primes, the prizes were a
sausage, tshirt, and hat for the first one, a water bottle and cage for
the second, and I don't even remember what the third was.  I just
remember hearing them, and thinking that first one was pretty sweet, and
I wanted it.  The other races earlier had growlers from Mountain State
Brewing, but we're just cat 5 I guess.  Those were half the reason I
signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2219" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;From the gun, we hit it real hard.  By we, I mean Christian and Jake on
the front of the race.  I felt bad that we were going so hard in the
beginner category, it was definitely not a beginner pace.  I was on the
back for the first 15 minutes, and then started to move up.  Within a
few laps, we were already lapping people, whoops.  I was waiting on the
first prime, and when I heard the bell I got up to about 5th wheel.
 Coming into the finish, there is a hard turn into a short steep uphill,
then a dowhill to the finish line.  Out of that last corner I was
something like 6th, and got on it.  As I crested the hill and looked
down at the start/finish, I was really far back from the first guy, with
quite a few people in the way, but I sprinted with everything I had and
weaved through them.  The first guy was still a bike length ahead of me
with 50 feet to go and I was sprinting hard, and right at the line I
threw my forward and jusssst put my front wheel ahead of his. Victory!
 That was the best sprint I think that I've ever put in race, maybe, I
made up serious ground and pimped that guy hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was cooked from that sprint, and luckily had gotten far enough ahead
that I could relax without anyone attacking on the next lap.  I just
hung in until the finish really, going for the second prime (think I got
second) but I wasn't going to burn my last match.  They put the last
prime with two laps to go...which meant that the next lap was going to
be fast for the prime, and then it was the last lap!  I hated it when
they did that to us last time.  But I knew enough not to sprint too hard
for that last prime so I could stay on the final lap, and didn't go for
the prime.  Luckily no one else went for too hard either, and we were
mostly together after it going into the last lap.  Into the fast
downhill turn 3, Jake A was first wheel and crushed the hard corner,
opening up a gap on second.  I was like 4 or 5th or something at this
point, and coming uphill out of the last corner was talking to myself.
 This is the last sprint Andy, give it everything you've got.  So I sat
on Jake's little train, and he was drilling it so no one was about to
come around.  In reality, it was a perfect leadout.  I came off of his
wheel sprinting, but didn't want to nab my own teammate at the line so I
think I held back a little, although I'm not even sure that I had more
anyway.  Jake crushed it all the way through the finish for the win,
which was sweet.  I flew around to the right for 3rd, which I was
totally happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did end up getting my sausage prime, and some pretty sweet socks and a
tshirt.  And for 3rd, I got \$15, which covered my entry fee, sweet!
Jake got \$35, which was awesome for him, he was working so hard the
whole race.  And I totally couldn't have won either the prime, or come
in third without being able to sit in the group while Christian was
working hard up front, so a big kudos to him as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing well in the race put me in a great mood, and we other really
strong performances on the day as well.  Everyone was happy, it was a
good day of racing.  I'll write about those other performances on the
cycling website, maybe.  Getting dinner was an adventure, it's freakin
tough making a decision with 15 people, but we eventually ended up at a
Chinese buffet which was good enough.  We were all tired, but chilled
until midnight before going to bed, talkin about girls and of course,
bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday: Road Race&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm out of time a little, I shall write later about the road race.

summer for the Modeling and Simulation in Systems Biology (MSSB) Reseach
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at the Virginia Bioinformatics
Institute (VBI)!! In short, the MSSB REU @VBI.  I'd been waiting a long
time to hear about where I was going to be this summer, and am really
glad that I got this.  Researching biology could be where I'm
headed...we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I've been working really hard these past few weeks on homework and
stuff, so having this past weekend off of racing was good as well.
 Although I definitely still got in some awesome riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Friday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing up HW and class, I spent pretty much all day running
around with Ruthie (her running me around really, she was driving) and I
rode her horse Scribby, we bottled beer, and all in all it was a really
fun afternoon.  This is the second time I've ridden, and it actually was
pretty scary this time.  Ruthie has been leading me around on the horse
so far, and at the end she was just walking next to me on the horse, and
we split up a little bit.  Then Scribby decided to go the other way, and
it's all a blur now, but before I knew it, I was out of the stirrups
galloping across the ring.  I pulled tighter on the reins, and got
scribby to stop before hitting the fence, then he ran again, this whole
time me thinking about whether or not I should just jump off, but
somehow I balanced and stayed on, and by pulling hard on one rein got
Scribby to stop until Ruthie could get there.  So...no riding solo for
me yet.  This whole riding horses thing isn't nearly as simple as it
looks.  I lean my bike right, and we go right.  A horse is a whole
different animal.  We also made it downtown to see Kati riding for Bike
and Build, ran like a thousand other errands, and bottled beer and made
dinner before I called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday: Epic Ride&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding in hail and a 30mph headwind, crossing rivers, climbing up into
the storm itself, and across the rocky ridgeline of Dragon's Back was
quite the feat. Andy W, George, and myself definitely got more than we
bargained for out there, but we made it back and it was actually a lot
of fun.  We set out at 9AM, planning a four hour ride, and didn't get
home till 6:30PM hungry and frozen.  I rode Dave's 29er, which was
sweet, and I think I'm going to buy it to ride this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we started, and were on 311 heading toward the trailhead, it
went from sunny to blistering headwind and hail.  The hail stung like no
other on my legs, and it was so so cold that I was definitely thinking
that we might not be able to attempt this.  When we got onto the gravel
road it felt warmer, the hail held off, but the "3 stream crossings"
turned out to be 6 attempts at crossing this huuge stream.  It was fun,
the strategy by the end was just to get as much speed as possible and
bomb into the water.  Once the wave from hitting the water collapsed
back, we would get totally soaked and it was so deep that at one point I
was pedaling with the whole drivetrain underwater.  I wonder if Shimano
designs for that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot more riding on fire road, we saw Kirby (who was helping put
on the race the next day) driving, which was good timing.  We thought
that we had passed the trailhead by our mileage, and we were right, he
told us it was 1.5mi back.  I think we at 16mi at that point.  The climb
up to the top of the ridge wasn't that rediculous, and we made it up
pretty quick.  The riding on the ridge was awesome, super rocky and
gorgeous views.  Some parts were so steep and long that it wasn't the
technical skills that made it hard, but having the fitness to pount for
10 minutes up those super steep climbs.  We could see the ridge the
whole way out, and they call it Dragon's Back because it looks like the
back of a dragon, with all the spikes along the top.  Those were what we
were going up and down.  We were literally on the ridge too, it was
steep down on both sides and we could see the mountains on either side
of us.  It was also pretty cool that we were up along the cloud line,
and when we're in the storm up top, it was snowing but not hard, like we
were riding through the snow that was barely falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy and I bonked pretty hard, and the last few climbs were really
tough.  George was crushing it, but eventually his legs gave out too.
 Kirby caught up with as he was marking the route, and we all rode back
which was cool.  The front derailer cable on Dave's bike finally bit the
dust entirely at the end, and I could only use the smallest ring...but I
didn't want more!&lt;/p&gt;

well."]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_20110402_131141-e1301938163910.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_20110402_131141-e1301938163910-300x224.jpg" title="Dragon's_Back_Ride"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Saturday night: Spandex Classic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tradition in the Blacksburg cycling community, Spandex Classic
consists of an impromptu, costume themed, le mans start, single speed, 3
lap race of the Drillfield with a huge "awards ceremony" that follows.
 This year's rendition was organized largely by Will Massey and myself,
and it was major success.  I rode in on the trike, with my single speed
over my shoulder, in full Spartan gear for a pretty epic entrance.
 Though I was tired from 6 hours of ridiculously hard mountain biking,
so my legs weren't quite up to the challenge of winning it, but Will
Massey came through (traffic) for the win!  Next year...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today hasn't been very productive, but I went on a really fun group ride
to the River and back with the triathlon team.  There was a huge
turnout, as they're preparing for Nationals next weekend, and having
that many triathletes on aero bikes riding in close proximity was
definitely scary, but got better towards the end.  Triathletes, not to
hate, aren't used to riding in big groups and it gets pretty hairy when
they all get together.  It was so crazy at the beginning with 20 tri
bikers that Justin almost regretted coming to this thing haha, but he
Chris and I kept our distance at the back and it was fine.  It really
was fine, and there was a noticable improvement by the end of the ride
of how comfortable everyone was.  Advertised (on the listserv) as an
easy ride, it was definitely very far from that, with some attacking and
then hammering the climbs.  But after getting warmed up, my legs
actually felt great, which suprised me after bonking super hard the day
before, and then all that SC entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've showered, taken a nap, and worked a little bit on C++
(remember the quiz too, make that 5/8!).  I'm going to pick stuff up
from Will's that I left there, and do some laundry now to get ready for
the week.  Two tests (boo), two wheels to build (yay), and then to WVU
this weekend, chyeah!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Racing</title><link href="/2011/03/30/racing-bikes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-30T08:57:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-30T08:57:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-03-30:/2011/03/30/racing-bikes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2198" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I drove down to Wake Forest with the Cycling Team and
we had an awesome weekend of racing.  The highlight was definitely Andy
W winning our crit race, with the teamwork we had going, including an
awesome leadout from Jake Andersson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had only gone on two rides since Duke (2 rides in three weeks) so I
was definitely out of form, but still had fun racing.  I attacked the
neutral rollout of the road race (nuetral meaning that there was
supposed to be no attacking before the turn) but got relegated
(officials made me wait for the group and go the back) which was really
just funny.  They shortened our race from 30mi to 20mi, which was really
pretty shitty because of how it changed the race.  The "reason" for
shortening it was a threat of rain, although we didn't get started until
45min late, and the extra 10 miles would have taken us much less than
that.  It changed the race by just making it super high intensity, since
it was now like a sprint.  I guess that I am to blame for the pace as
well, attacking so early.  And then attacking again.  But, after the
steep little climb I was OTB, but caught up with a two guys and we
worked together super well, which was awesome.  I may have gotten a more
steady workout than the front group, and it felt great to actually do
some good pacelining.  We brought back two people in the course of the
next two laps, and when we got a few miles from the finish we kicked it
hard.  I got to the front of the paceline, knew we were close, and one
of the guys said "hit it!" So I put it in the big ring, and jammed for a
half mile.  We were flying, at close to 30mph on the flat section with
that pull, and the other four guys kept the pace super super high until
the last curve.  I knew the curve was right before the finish, and was
second wheel, so when the guy in front of me pulled off, I held his
wheel.  Quickly, everyone else saw the finish and UNC went by me on the
right in a sprint.  I got behind him, hung there for a hundred meters,
and then came around and won the sprint.  The picture above is that
sprint, and apparently we dropped two of our five in the last half mile
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting back to hotel and all getting showered, we trekked on foot
the mall (like two miles away) and got food, it's really tough finding
something that will suit 23 different people.  There was a Moe's across
the street, but that got veto'ed on account of Ben thinking it made him
sick the past Monday.  But it was good, and I ended up falling asleep at
8PM.  I opened up my number theory book and start to do HW on it at
7:50, and it hit me like a tsunami of tiredness (too soon?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was freezing cold for the crit, but we all found motivation to race
and it ended up awesome.  Like I mentioned earlier, Andy W took the
sprint for the win.  See http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu for a post that I
wrote about the weekend, with some pictures of him winning, and Jake
behind him.  Zach and I got off the front with three laps to go, and I
think we could've held it because I was fresh, but we worked just hard
enough to make App State tire themselves out for the finish by pulling
us back.  And then Jake laid down the hurt, so no one was even thinking
about attacking the last lap, with Andy W on his wheel and pulled off
through the last corner, also blocking the inside for the sprint.  I won
one prime lap, and got second in another (Andy W got second in the third
prime), but they had me down as getting second in both, oh well.  On the
first one, I sprinted for it, and Olu (the guy from App State ahead of
Andy in the overall standings right now) got a front flat and went over
his handlebars.  I hope he's alright.  There's nothing you can do about
a front flat, but looking at the road race pictures he needs to work on
his sprint form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the past weekend, and I've actually trained hard all 3 days
this week, including today in 34F and drizzle going really hard at
&lt;a href="http://wednesdayworlds.org/"&gt;Wednesday Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.  Yesterday we did crit
training at the CRC, and that was a really hard workout, racing around
with the A's at super high intensity.  Then we rode around town for
awhile too.  On Monday (I guess I'm going backwards now) I went to the
SAYG ride because I felt so obligated to, 3 emails went out for it back
to back! By  induction, I figured there would be like 20 people, but the
35F weather was too cold I guess, and it ended up that of the 5 people
that came, 3 had send emails about the ride, back to back! There's a
slight delay in the listserv, so one of them got the others before
theirs went out, and they were all within 5min, all anouncing a SAYG
Ride at 4PM haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow shall be an off day!  Maybe I'll run one lap of the
drillfield: &lt;a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/stories/17227/rumors-about-naked-race-running-rampant"&gt;http://www.collegiatetimes.com/stories/17227/rumors-about-naked-race-running-rampant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>On glasses...</title><link href="/2011/03/29/on-glasses/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-29T13:59:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-03-29T13:59:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-03-29:/2011/03/29/on-glasses/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dan.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dan.png" title="dan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dan.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dan.png" title="dan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Spring Break</title><link href="/2011/03/14/spring-break/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-14T08:22:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-03-14T08:22:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-03-14:/2011/03/14/spring-break/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My spring break flew by, but in short it was great being able to see my

this past weekend.  I got in a really solid week of training in addition
to getting on the podium in my first homebrew competition during the
week, and did well academically as well.  Here's a recap of the whole
week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Week's worth of Training&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday: despite the tornado and severe weather advisory, Kelly and I
ventured out into a downpour for a SAYG ride on Monday.  She's just
getting back into riding after to rehabilitate a knee injury, and I
figured that it was going to be warm enough to get wet.  Wearing just a
jersey and shorts in the pouring rain, I froze but it was fun ride.  The
rain seems to make everything quiet, and I'm glad that Kelly is on her
way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday: without hitting snooze too many times, I made it out to
Justin's 7:30 AM ride, and Zach Morrey came as well.  Zach felt like
hammering, and drilled it all the way out Mt. Tabor Rd. to Rt. 311.  He
had his headphones in and just wanted to go hard, so Justin and I eased
up on the way back Blacksburg Rd and up Harding, since I was pretty
tired from killing all those climbs and it was such a gorgeous morning
that we wanted to enjoy it.  Rode for about 2.5 hrs, and I was bonking
up Harding but still turned in a time of 15min, not too bad. (faster
than I could've ever gone freshman year....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday: extending from my C training ride the previous week, Andy W
led a crushingly hard ride at 3PM.  Earp from the tri team sent out a
ride at the same time, and we had a really big turnout for a training
ride, and it was an amazing day out.  Jersey and shorts again! We did
the Wednesday Worlds loop, with Nick and I leading it out to Blackburg
Rd.  Once we got going, it was hard attack followed by hard attack.
 Nick would sprint away, and we would all pull really hard till he was
caught, and then someone else would immediately sprint away hard.  This
kept going until we were all exhausted, and the group was completely
shattered.  At the end, I chased down Bradner's final attack and
outsprinted him to Sandy Ridge Rd for first on the way out.  We were all
hurtin by that point, so Nick and I chilled up Sandy Ridge, and the tri
kids took a right at the top.  The cycling guys went left, and we
reluctantly decided to do a B vs C race, which was 3 on 4, respectively.
 Nick and Tyler rode off the front with a sneaky block from Chris Brown,
so John G, George and I went after them.  After a few of the hills, it
was just me chasing.  I closed down the gap to about 15 seconds at the
tops of the hills, but by the bottom of the next one they were gapping
me more.  When I realized that, solo, I couldn't chase down two B's...I
waited for George.  And Chris B was with him.  I thought George was
closer and that we would be able to work together to catch the two
ahead, but I waited for more than a minute for him to catch up, so the
race was over for the most part.  We all stopped at the Church on Tabor
and waited for everyone, it was a great ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday: Cole's Real Person Ride was at 7AM and Kelsea had asked me
earlier if she could use me as a cyclist for a photojournalism project,
so I told her that she should get up super early and come follow us on
the ride.  I expected there to be at least a few people there, but it
was just Justin, Cole, and I.  For it being such a warm day the day
before, I very reluctantly dressed for the sub-freezing temperatures
that early in the morning.  Kelsea's Mom drove her car, and she leaned
out the window and took pictures (close to 500) of our ride.  Cole
turned back after only a couple miles for a headache that he had hoped
would go away, but Justin and I still enjoyed feeling like celebrities
with paparazzi along the ride.  I'll post up some of the pictures here
once I sort through them.  We rode the Tabor -&gt; Gravel Hill -&gt;
Blacksburg -&gt; Harding route.  Here is the
ride: &lt;a href="http://ridewithgps.com/trips/184306"&gt;http://ridewithgps.com/trips/184306&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday: no ride! Except commuting on the fixed gear to Blacksburg
Transit for a meeting which was 5 miles each way (and also to class,
like every day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Homebrew Competition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Virginia Tech Homebrew Club
(&lt;a href="http://hokiehomebrew.com/"&gt;hokiehomebrew.com&lt;/a&gt;) we decided last
semester to do a brewing competition, with a goal of brewing a specific
&lt;a href="http://www.dogfish.com/"&gt;Dogfish Head&lt;/a&gt; beer.  I chose to brew a Raison
D'etre clone, and brewed it with Will French about a month ago.  Without
as much time to sit in secondary as I had hoped, the half that I kegged
came out awesome.  For my first judged beer, I did really well, placing
3rd in the competition (out of 8) and scoring a 37.5/50, enough for a
bottle of DFH Olde School (a barley wine, yes!) and a DFH hat, both from
Sam himself.  The judging took place Wednesday night, and we'll do
prizes the Tuesday that we get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Classes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all of tests were the previous week (so we got grades back before
the drop deadline), I don't have much to report other than a 95 on my
Numerical Analysis project, which I'm pretty stoked about.  If I had a
color printer, I would've gotten a 100...whoops.  I left late Friday to
go to Justin's house where we were staying because I wanted to go to
dinner at Bull and Bones with Reinhard and the research group, and since
Andy W was driving down separate anyway, we got on the road at 8PM.  We
had planned on leaving at 7PM, and had we left then, we might've even
beat the team down there who left at 4PM, since they stopped and had a
long, expensive dinner at Carrabas that Andy and I weren't at
all disappointed to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday Road Race&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road race on Saturday was two laps of a 14-mile loop, that was
mostly rolling of consisted of two (maybe 3) climbs that could be
considered decent hills.  The other inclines were just power climbs, aka
short enough to sprint up.  I started at the front of the race, and
stayed there for almost the whole first lap, until Christian went off
the front on the second climb.  At the beginning of the race everyone at
the front was really chatty, and we were all joking around which was
fun.  I was sitting up fiddling with my powertap at one point while out
front, and Zac jokingly yelled "sit down asshole" and some other people
were like "yeah!" it was funny.  After a downhill, we all hit the first
climb and I stood up a jammed all the way up.  At the bottom, everyone
was talking and by the top all I could hear was gears shifting...I made
'em hurt!  Other than sprinting up the hills, I pulled really easily.
 But somehow, you always manage to do more work than you think you are
doing on the front, and I could feel that after the race for sure.  The
powertap, from my back pocket, wasn't giving me any clues.  I bridged up
to one attack that I nearly certain would stick, since Navy, App and VT
(me) were all in it (along with a strong kid from VCU)...and I'd like to
know who chased that down.  Hopefully it wasn't a team of anyone in
it...jerks.  Anyway, I slipped to the back of the field with about 5
miles to go when Zac attacked, and was surprised that he got pulled in.
 He blew by the field when he went, zoom!  From there, I made some
aggressive moves and got to the front with a couple miles left.  I got
stuck on the front row, which I didn't think was all bad because the
whole group was getting noticeably anxious about the upcoming sprint.
 One guy attacked, but nobody thought he would be able to stay out front
on the last stretch when the group accelerated, so neither I nor anyone
else wanted to chase.  A huge effort on his part though, he managed to
stay out front the whole time, and won.  We got within 20 meters of him
at the finish, but he had just enough gap.  As I accelerated on the
front for the sprint, I thought I had a pretty good chance to just jump
off the front, and realized I would need more gear than I had in small
ring (I was already sitting in the smallest).  When I shifted up with
100 meters to go though, my chain flew off and I watched the field
sprint by.  A very disappointing finish, besides the fact Andy W snuck
around for 3rd.  I had a  lot of fun in the race, although I do wish I
could've given it a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The races finished early, and we got back to Justin's house with some
time before dinner.  We played on the trampoline, the swings, and had a
huge game of ultimate frisbee in the front yard.  It was a great time,
and so warm that we were playing shirts on skins! The teams were tri vs
cycling, and I qualified to be on the winning tri team because of my one
triathlon, yeah!  Dinner from the Crawford's was delicious, and just
what we all needed!  We also got to surprise Justin's sister's friend MT
by singing happy birthday when she came over haha.  After a few games of
celebrity, we called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday Criterium&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It poured rain Sunday on the parking lot criterium course on Duke's
campus, and it was tough to get out of the car into the rain to go warm
up.  I ended up taking a warm up through Duke Campus and it is so
beautiful...I got totally lost and had to speed back.  I made it back
just in time, thank you sense of direction!  Smartly, the C field took
the first few laps very cautious through the turns, still sprinting hard
on the straights though.  They had lined us up wider than the first
turn, so I had to make use of more than the course to get around and
make it in good position, and nobody said anything.  The race was good,
I could handle the wet turns really well and was on the front, or very
near it, for the whole race.  Coming into the last lap, I made a move
into fourth wheel where I wanted to be.  Coming out of the last corner
into the finish, I shifted down and sprinted...but had picked too big of
a gear and didn't get a great acceleration, so I only put half a wheel
into the guy ahead of me, darn! Andy W finished on my wheel for 5th
place as well.  After a cool down, my legs were tired but I decided to
give it a shot in the B crit as well, and talked Andy W into joining me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lined up at the back, and as Kevin shouted our rules to us (no
attacking, chasing breaks, working for teammates) I told him that we
planned on getting dropped in 5 laps anyway, and the group got a laugh
out of that.  After the start, Andy and I were near dead last, but I
made some more moves and starting moving up.  I passed a lot of people
in the corners, as it was raining and they were really hard turns.  I
could actually gain a lot of ground and took the corners harder than
most of the field, it probably helped that I had been railing through
them for 30 minutes earlier.  I passed Chris, Will, Cecil and John and
was like "cmon, boys!!" as I went by, hoping they'd grab my wheel and
move up.  Eventually the field had split into two groups, and I was in
the back one.  Tyler was the only Tech guy in front of me, in the front
group.  Before too long, Chris caught me and I pulled him as hard as I
could for half a lap and then he took off, making a massive effort to
bridge to the front group.  Idk how he does that....he would be so much
fresher if just stayed up front, but I couldn't hang onto that move. The
back group disintegrated pretty much, and it was eventually just me and
a couple other guys that hadn't been lapped.  I ended up working for a
few laps with a guy from Navy that seemed cool actually, and then for
the rest of the race with a different guy from some school until I
gapped him when the leaders caught up to us.  Two guys were off the
front of the lead group, and once they did catch me, I stuck their
wheels.  They weren't actually going that hard...I could hang on just
fine, especially through the corners.  After a few laps of sitting on
them, coming into the really sharp top corner, they both slipped out.  I
nearly hit them as well, since I was right on their wheel, but managed
to avoid the slippery crash.  Yeah for bike handling!  Since I pretty
much stopped for that, by the time I got going again the main pack was
about to lap me, so I got pulled.  I counted, and had I been a B, I
would've scored in 13th.  I was really happy with that, and had so much
fun flying through the corners in the rain.  Chris and I both were
hitting the corners with no brakes like they were dry, with an inch of
rain on the pavement, and that was an adrenaline rush for sure.  Outside
of a race, I couldn't imagine taking corners like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to be getting on the road to Philly today, although I do
have a lot to do first, and then getting home tomorrow!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tough Week Recap</title><link href="/2011/02/27/tough-week-recap/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-27T23:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-02-27T23:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-02-27:/2011/02/27/tough-week-recap/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mom and Pops, sorry I didn't get a chance to call today, I was doing HW

&lt;p&gt;Figured I'd talk about this week, since I've survived in good health and
high spirits.  I still do have a hard exam coming up Tuesday, but I
think that I can do well if I study a lot.  Whoops, I just looked and
the midterm isn't till a week after that, on the 15th...we don't have
class Tuesday! So that means I don't have class till 5PM...I'm thinking
time for a long ride finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got B on the number theory test, which I was happy with.  I
messed up a little on one problem (there were 6 hard proofs) so I can
still feel good about it, had I not made that mistake I would've had an
A! Class avg was a C.  I'm standing at a B in the class.  In Advanced
Calc, I got an 83 on the test which was actually a little better than I
thought I had done immediately after taking it, and it being one of the
hardest 3000-levels at the university (supposively), I'll take that one
too.  I have a 92 HW average which is great, so I can possibly pull a
low A in the class.  I finished and handed in my numerical analysis
computing project, which was a whole bunch of writing MATLAB polynomial
interpolation algorithms, and it wasn't too too hard but took me a lot
of time.  On Tuesday, I left the house near 7AM and didn't return until
10:30PM.  In the middle of the day, I had to decide between going on a
training ride, d2 (food) or going to the job fair with the resumes I had
printed out.  I ended up going to d2, since I do need to eat food, and
then taking the extra time to work hard on my presentation for research
that I had at 4.  The presentation went really well, and I'm super
anxious to hear about whether or not I get the job offer this summer.  
Really hoping for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, on Monday our intramural basketball team lost in the
playoffs, but we have one more game tomorrow at 7:30.  I'm pretty pumped
to shoot some hoops after the game...I know can out free throw the VT
team...42%...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night I finished welding the trike back together, which was my
release for the day.  Thursday I did as much C++ programming as I could,
to free my mind from MATLAB and LaTeX before the exam at 5PM.  I think
the exam went well, I'll find out soon enough.  Actually I just went and
it was up....83.  Not too pleased with that.  But it's only 10% of the
grade, and the 6 projects are worth 50%, and I knocked out the one due
Friday on Monday and got an 104 on it.  I got  an 104 on the first one
too...I'll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the exam on Thursday, Dave and I went camping up above Mtn Lake at
the War Spur overlook.  We set out for Wind Rock, but the fire road was
pretty washed out with some boulders that I didn't end up risking my oil
pan on.  People thought we were crazy, since it was raining for the
first time in a long time, and was pretty freaking cold.  But out there
hiking, it wasn't too wet and I was down to a t-shirt, carrying in my
frame backpack on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning is when I finished putting the trike together before
class.  I actually rode it to class which was fun, and towed some people
around.  After more delicious d2 for lunch (I went a total of 4 times
this week somehow), I used the trike to deliver water bottles to the
team, to East Coasters, and pick up Christian's truing stand.  That
night, I went to build a wheel....and totally failed. I had made the
order online with a hub in it, but Dave wanted to use his own hub so we
just deleted the one online, but we bought a 32 hole rim, 33
spokes...and his hub was 36 spoke! I didn't realize it until I had the
stand all set up, nipples out and was putting the spokes into the rim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night I went to a salsa dancing thing that CRU put on, with
Jessey, and had a lot of fun.  I was pleasantly suprised that I knew a
bunch of people there...Bryan and Katie Matthews and basically everyone
I know from CRU. And Olivia from Tri team too! I was really needing to
finish the beer in my keg, and Stephan came over so kindly to help me
out, we were planning on going downtown to grill and sell hot dogs from
the trike.  I thought that there were at most a couple of beers left, so
I opened the whole keg up, and uh-oh...it was slightly full.  Well, not
full, but close to a gallon or something! It had felt so light.  Had I
known, I should have recruited more help!! We managed to finish it...ohh
so good black IPA...but didn't make it downtown lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was a lot of fun, I'm probably repeating a bunch from the
previous posts.  After going to college gameday in the AM and getting
some HW done (gameday was super cool, I got four carol lee donuts for
free for brkfst!), Jeff and I started a day of building, brewing, and
kegging with a trip on the trike to Eats for brewing supplies.  Jeff
isn't a small guy by any means, but we made it there! I'm sure Main St
traffic wasn't as appreciative, but oh well for them.  We managed to keg
my Raison D'etre for Tuesday's competition, brew the IPA (well...maybe
an I*amber*A really, it's not pale), and build a bench onto the trike.
 Before the game, I made three trips from the parking lot below Lane up
to Cassell...and I think I shoulda picked a path that wasn't up the side
of a hill! The first group of took up, of two people, bet me that I
couldn't get all of us and the huge bike up the hill...well I showed
them wrong! The lady was a cyclist, and she was thoroughly impressed,
said I must've had "legs of steel" cuz we were cruisin up the hill
blowin by traffic and everybody walking.  I then took one guy up, which
was a slight relief to legs, and went down for a final trip.  I talked a
group of three into taking a ride up, and as a challenge! They didn't
think I could do it either.... I stood and pedaled for everything I was
worth all the way up that hill, and got all four us and the bike to the
top!!  I would've loved to have had a power meter on that ride, we were
cookin up the hill...and I was pretty close to collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was amazing, check out the video in the previous post!  And
then today, I slept in (a lot) and have finished all of my work for the
week!  To do my math HW, I usually write it out then type it into an
email since I don't have a LaTeX compiler on the computer.  Sometimes, I
just straight do the HW on the computer, but that's hard to do.  Here's
what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;address&gt;
item 2.7.1: Proving the Alternating Series Test (Thm 2.7.7) amounts to
showing that the sequence of partial sums&lt;br&gt;
 begin{equation*}&lt;br&gt;
 s_n = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - ldots pm a_n&lt;br&gt;
 end{equation*}&lt;br&gt;
 converges.  (The opening example in Section 2.1 includes a typical
illustration of (\$s_n\$).)  Different characterizations lead to
different proofs, and I will prove this by showing that \$(s_n)\$ is
a Cauchy sequence.&lt;br&gt;
 underline{Proof:} Let \$(a_n)\$ be a strictly decreasing sequence
with \$(a_n) rightarrow 0\$.&lt;br&gt;
 Since \$(a_n) rightarrow 0, forall epsilon &gt; 0\$ being given\$,
exists N in mathbb{R}\$ s.t. \$forall n &gt; N, |a_n - 0| = |a_n| \&amp;lt;
epsilon\$.&lt;br&gt;
 Note that since \$(a_n)\$ is decreasing, this implies for \$m geq
n\$, \$|a_{m}| \&amp;lt; epsilon\$.&lt;br&gt;
 I will now show that sequence of partial sums \$(s_n)\$ is Cauchy.&lt;br&gt;
 For the same \$N\$ above, and for all \$n geq m &gt; N\$,&lt;br&gt;
 begin{equation*} begin{align} | s_n - s_m | &amp;amp; = | a_1 - a_2 +
a_3 - ldots pm a_m pm a_{m + 1} pm ldots pm a_n - (a_1 - a_2 +
a_3 - ldots pm a_m)\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; = | pm a_{m + 1} pm a_{m + 2} pm ldots pm a_n |\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; text{Taking the abs. value of each term, which can only be
greater,}\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; leq | pm | a_{m + 1} | pm | a_{m + 2} | pm ldots pm | a_n | |\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; text{And since, \$m, n &gt; N\$ then}\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; \&amp;lt; | pm epsilon pm epsilon pm ldots pm epsilon|end{align}
end{equation*}&lt;br&gt;
 If \$(n - m)\$ is even, then since the terms are alternating sign,
this equals 0, which is clearly less than any \$epsilon &gt; 0\$.  If
the difference (number of terms) is odd, then it becomes \$| pm
epsilon | = epsilon\$ and so \$| s_n - s_m | \&amp;lt; epsilon forall
epsilon &gt; 0\$, as claimed.//&lt;br&gt;
 item 2.7.2(a): Provide the details for the proof of the Comparison
Test (Thm 2.7.4) using the Cauchy Criterion for series.&lt;br&gt;
 Let \$epsilon &gt; 0\$ be given, and then since the greater sequence of
\$b_k\$'s converges, take that \$N\$ and look at the \$(m + 1)\$
through \$n\$ expansion of \$a_n\$'s and this is less than or equal
to the expansion of \$b_n\$'s which is less than \$epsilon\$.&lt;br&gt;
 item 2.7.6: (a) Show that is \$sum x_n\$ converges absolutely, and
the sequence \$(y_n)\$ is bounded, then the sum \$sum x_n y_n\$
converges.&lt;br&gt;
 underline{Proof:} Let \$sum x_n\$ converge absolutely, and the
sequence \$(y_n)\$ be bounded.  Since  \$sum x_n\$ converges
absolutely, we know that given \$epsilon &gt; 0, exists N in mathbb{R}\$
s.t. \$forall n &gt; m geq N\$&lt;br&gt;
 begin{equation*} |x_{m + 1}| + |x_{m + 2}| + ldots + |x_n| \&amp;lt;
frac{epsilon}{M} end{equation*}&lt;br&gt;
 where \$M\$ is the bound of \$(y_n)\$.  Then for all \$n &gt; m geq
N\$,&lt;br&gt;
 begin{equation*} begin{align*} &amp;amp; |y_{m + 1}x_{m + 1} + y_{m +
2}x_{m + 2} + ldots + y_{n}x_{n}|\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; text{By the Triangle Inequality,}\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; leq |y_{m + 1}x_{m + 1}| + |y_{m + 2}x_{m + 2}| + ldots +
|y_{n}x_{n}|\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; leq |M x_{m + 1}| + |M x_{m + 2}| + ldots + |M x_{n}|\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; text{Since M is positive,}\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; = Mcdot |x_{m + 1}| + Mcdot |x_{m + 2}| + ldots + Mcdot
|x_{n}|\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; = Mcdot ( |x_{m + 1}| + |x_{m + 2}| + ldots + |x_{n}| )\&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;amp; \&amp;lt; Mcdot (frac{epsilon}{M}) = epsilon end{align*} end{equation*}&lt;br&gt;
 So \$x_n y_n\$ converges, as claimed.//\&lt;br&gt;
 (b) Find a counterexample that demonstrates that part (a) does not
always hold if the convergence of \$sum x_n\$ is conditional.&lt;br&gt;
 Let \$x_n = dfrac{(-1)\^n}{n}\$ and \$y_n = (-1)\^n\$.  We have
seen that \$x_n\$ converges conditionally, and \$x_ny_n\$ which is
the harmonic series, does not converge.&lt;br&gt;
 item 2.7.9 (Ratio Test): Given a series \$sum\^{infy}_{n = 1} a_n\$
with \$a_n ne 0\$, the Ratio Test states that if \$(a_n)\$
satisifies&lt;br&gt;
 begin{equation*} text{lim } | frac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n} | = r \&amp;lt; 1
end{equation*}&lt;br&gt;
 then the series converges absolutely.&lt;br&gt;
 (a) Let \$r'\$ satisfy \$r \&amp;lt; r' \&amp;lt; 1\$.  (Why must such an \$r'\$
exist?)  Explain why there exists an \$N\$ such that \$n geq N\$
implies \$|a_{n + 1}| leq |a_n| r'\$.&lt;br&gt;
 Such an \$r'\$ must exists by the axiom of completeness, and the open
interval with an upper bound of 1.&lt;br&gt;
 (b) Why does \$|a_N| sum (r')\^n\$ necessarily converge?&lt;br&gt;
 (c) Now, show that \$sum |a_n|\$ converges.&lt;br&gt;
 item 3.2.4) Prove the converse of Thm 3.2.5 by showing that if \$x\$
= lim \$a_n\$ for some sequence \$(a_n)\$ contained in \$A\$
satisfying \$a_n ne a\$, then \$x\$ is a limit point of \$A\$.&lt;br&gt;
 underline{Proof:} Let \$x\$ = lim \$a_n\$, \$a_n ne x, (a_n)
subset A\$.&lt;br&gt;
 I will show \$forall epsilon &gt; 0, V_{epsilon} (x)\$ intersects
\$A\$ at some point not equal to \$x\$.&lt;br&gt;
 Let \$epsilon &gt; 0\$ be given, and by definition, \$V_{epsilon} (x)
= { y in mathbb{R} : |y - x| \&amp;lt; epsilon }\$.&lt;br&gt;
 Then \$exists N in mathbb{R}\$ s.t. \$forall n &gt; N\$, \$|a_n - x|
\&amp;lt; epsilon\$.&lt;br&gt;
 By hypothesis, \$a_n in A\$ and \$a_n ne x\$.  Also, since \$|a_n
- x| \&amp;lt; epsilon Rightarrow a_n in V_{epsilon} (x)\$.&lt;br&gt;
 \$a_n (ne x) in V_{epsilon} (x) intersect A\$.  Therefore, \$x\$ is
a limit point of \$A\$.&lt;br&gt;
 item 3.2.7) Let \$x in O\$, an open set.  If \$(x_n)\$ is a sequence
converging to \$x\$, prove that all but a finite number of the terms
of \$(x_n)\$ must be contained in \$O\$.&lt;br&gt;
 underline{Proof:} Since \$O\$ is an open set, \$exists V_{epsilon}
(x) subset O\$.  Let \$epsilon &gt; 0\$ be given, such that
\$V_{epsilon} (x) subset O\$.  Since \$x_n rightarrow x\$, \$exists
N in mathbb{R}\$ st \$forall n in mathbb{N}, n &gt; N Rightarrow |x_n -
x| \&amp;lt; epsilon Rightarrow x_n in V_{epsilon} (x)\$.&lt;br&gt;
 So for \$n &gt; N\$, \$x_n subset V_{epsilon} (x) subset O\$.
 Therefore, for at most \$n\$ terms is \$(x_n) nsubset O\$.&lt;br&gt;
 item 3.3.4) Show that if \$K\$ is compact and \$F\$ is closed, then
\$K intersect F\$ is compact.&lt;br&gt;
 underline{Proof:} I will show that \$K intersect F\$ is closed and
bounded, and then by the HB Thm \$K intersect F\$ is compact.&lt;br&gt;
 By the HB Thm, \$K\$ is closed and bounded. Let \$x\$ be a limit
point of \$K intersect F\$.  Then \$x\$ is also a limit point of \$K\$
and \$F\$.  Since \$K\$ is closed, \$x in K\$.  Since \$F\$ is closed,
\$x in F\$.  Therefore, \$x in K intersect F\$.  So \$K intersect F\$
is closed.&lt;br&gt;
 Since \$K\$ is bounded, let \$M &gt; 0\$ be the bound of \$K\$.
 Therefore, \$a in K Rightarrow |a| leq M forall a in M\$.&lt;br&gt;
 \$a in K intersect F Rightarrow a in K Rightarrow |a| \&amp;lt; M.\$&lt;br&gt;
 Therefore, \$K intersect F\$ is bounded.  As claimed.//&lt;br&gt;
 item 2.7.1: Proving the Alternating Series Test (Thm 2.7.7) amounts
to showing that the sequence of partial sumsbegin{equation*}s_n =
a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - ldots pm a_nend{equation*}converges.  (The
opening example in Section 2.1 includes a typical illustration of
(\$s_n\$).)  Different characterizations lead to different proofs,
and I will prove this by showing that \$(s_n)\$ is a Cauchy
sequence.underline{Proof:} Let \$(a_n)\$ be a strictly decreasing
sequence with \$(a_n) rightarrow 0\$.Since \$(a_n) rightarrow 0,
forall epsilon &gt; 0\$ being given\$, exists N in mathbb{R}\$ s.t.
\$forall n &gt; N, |a_n - 0| = |a_n| \&amp;lt; epsilon\$.Note that since
\$(a_n)\$ is decreasing, this implies for \$m geq n\$, \$|a_{m}| \&amp;lt;
epsilon\$.I will now show that sequence of partial sums \$(s_n)\$ is
Cauchy.For the same \$N\$ above, and for all \$n geq m &gt;
N\$,begin{equation*} begin{align} | s_n - s_m | &amp;amp; = | a_1 - a_2 +
a_3 - ldots pm a_m pm a_{m + 1} pm ldots pm a_n - (a_1 - a_2 +
a_3 - ldots pm a_m)\&amp;amp; = | pm a_{m + 1} pm a_{m + 2} pm ldots pm
a_n |\&amp;amp; text{Taking the abs. value of each term, which can only be
greater,}\&amp;amp; leq | pm | a_{m + 1} | pm | a_{m + 2} | pm ldots pm |
a_n | |\&amp;amp; text{And since, \$m, n &gt; N\$ then}\&amp;amp; \&amp;lt; | pm epsilon pm
epsilon pm ldots pm epsilon|end{align} end{equation*}If \$(n - m)\$
is even, then since the terms are alternating sign, this equals 0,
which is clearly less than any \$epsilon &gt; 0\$.  If the difference
(number of terms) is odd, then it becomes \$| pm epsilon | = epsilon\$
and so \$| s_n - s_m | \&amp;lt; epsilon forall epsilon &gt; 0\$, as
claimed.//item 2.7.2(a): Provide the details for the proof of the

s.t. \$forall n &gt; m geq N\$begin{equation*} |x_{m + 1}| + |x_{m +
2}| + ldots + |x_n| \&amp;lt; frac{epsilon}{M} end{equation*}where \$M\$ is
the bound of \$(y_n)\$.  Then for all \$n &gt; m geq
N\$,begin{equation*} begin{align*} &amp;amp; |y_{m + 1}x_{m + 1} + y_{m +

Mcdot |x_{m + 2}| + ldots + Mcdot |x_{n}|\&amp;amp; = Mcdot ( |x_{m + 1}|
+ |x_{m + 2}| + ldots + |x_{n}| )\&amp;amp; \&amp;lt; Mcdot (frac{epsilon}{M}) =
epsilon end{align*} end{equation*}So \$x_n y_n\$ converges, as
claimed.//\(b) Find a counterexample that demonstrates that part (a)

closed.Since \$K\$ is bounded, let \$M &gt; 0\$ be the bound of \$K\$.
 Therefore, \$a in K Rightarrow |a| leq M forall a in M\$.\$a in K

&lt;p&gt;I'll post up what that actually comes on looking like, it looks great.
 It's actually the typesetting program that mathematicians use to write
papers to submit them to journals, and probably what my textbook is
written in.  Useful to know I suppose.  &lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3224_HW5.pdf"&gt;Here is what it comes out
to.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. This week: not as crazy, going to decide about
spring break plans (possibly traveling home, we shall see).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode it to class this morning as well, and I got some pretty good
looks.  Towed stephan up to McBryde and his bike, on the back, and that
was tough.  Then I gave some girls on the drillfield rides and confirmed
that I'm probably going DT tonight to tow people around for fun lol.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>William and Mary Weekend</title><link href="/2011/02/20/william-and-mary-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-20T21:01:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-02-20T21:01:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-02-20:/2011/02/20/william-and-mary-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I didn't crash this past weekend.  So, already more successful

than last year! Unfortunately (or, fortunately since there were some
crashes later in the race) my chain broke 12 miles into the road race.
 I had stood up to climb, felt it snap, and there was nothing I could do
but watch it slinky off my derailer and the field move around me up the
hill.  I caught a ride back with the wheel truck, and watched other
races while waiting for my time trial later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2130" align="aligncenter" width="300"
caption="Right up till the chain
broke"]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/RR.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/RR-300x149.png" title="RR"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donned the speedsuit and areo-helmet for the TT, but ACCC Conference
Director Kevin Long made a "judgement call" and didn't allow aero
helmets.  The rules state two things for TT's: gear must be mass-start
legal, and that no aero gear is allowed.  But there is no metric by
which a helmet, wheel or frame is deemed to be more "aero" than any
other in the rule book.  So for the past two years, the rule of
mass-start legal has been what we've gone by.  People were allowed to do
the time trial with frames and wheels that were much more aerodynamic
than my own, and helmets that may have been more aero than my Giro
Prolight...but I wasn't allowed to wear my Giro Advantage 2 helmet.  I
thought it was a pretty shitty call, because there isn't any metric by
which it was controlled, and it was made at the very last minute.  If
it's voted into the  rule book that a helmet "can't extend x cm behind
the head" then that would have been fine by me, but Kevin was just
making things up as he went, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I dialed it in at an average of 305W (not being able to hold my
goal of 330) and finished 13th of 40-some overall. Not too bad, but just
out of the points by a few seconds.  Second that I would have had with
an aero helmet...but oh well.  Average speed of 22.5mph for the 13
miles.  I averaged more in both the C and B crit on Sunday with really
uneven efforts, I just must not be able to push so hard into the pain by
myself in the TT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2131" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;The crit on Sunday was super fun, and I felt great.  Even ended up
riding most of the Men's B crit, then going for a 30min run.  About 10
minutes into the race, with two people solo out front of the group and
the race pretty much strung out, there was a lead group of about 15
including 5 of us from VT.  Jake A got on the front and was going really
hard, and I was second wheel so I eased up and let him ride away from
the group, thinking that he was strong enough to hold a break and
hopefully sprint the finish, I knew he really wanted to do well.  He got
about 100m out front before anyone from the group realized I was
blocking, and they sprinted after him.  Two guys got out and bridged the
gap, while I just tried to cover.  I could see Jake pulling for all he
was worth those two guys around, and they opened up a reasonable gap.  I
was worried though because I hadn't seen him off the front of that group
though.  The four remaining Tech guys in the group did a good job of not
going to hard to catch Jake, and not letting anyone get away to bridge
solo.  The idea is to keep the pace relaxed when on the front, and if
someone else wants to sprint away and catch the lead group, I pull the
rest of our group up to him so he will have to pull the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; group up
the lead group if he wants to go.  That's blocking, and covering
attacks.  It's generally not too hard, since the goal is to go easier on
the front, but covering attacks can be tough.  Will did some pretty
strong pulling, which I was kinda worried about, but not so hard that we
caught Jake.  With 5 laps to go, and Jake a decent ways away, Andy W
attacked and got a gap.  The pace of our group went crazy, and the rest
went after him.  I sat on the guys chasing Andy, and they did catch him.
 I was slightly surprised that Andy couldn't hold the attack, I thought
he would.  With two laps to go, we really picked it up and the race was
on for the finish.  One lap to go, and I got into great position, third
wheel behind two Navy guys.  One was trying to lead the other out...but
he was bringin me too! He pulled off for the straightaway sprint, Navy
sprinted and I hit it to his right side, sprinting hard by him to the
line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was awesome to win the sprint, although there were four people out
front so I only got 5th, but that didn't matter. Jake got fourth, which
was okay but I would've hoped he'd won the sprint for 2nd or 3rd.  Andy
W was on my wheel, and came in 7th.  As a team, we really controlled the
race, and I think everyone was really happy about it.  I set a new
sprint power, at 1422W, nearly two horsepower! And that was in my small
ring...&lt;/p&gt;

caption="The C Crit, lots of surging! Notice two big spikes near the

&lt;p&gt;Since I felt like I hadn't worked all too hard, I sat in the back of the
B crit for as long as I could hang on.  Having started at the very back,
I was getting sling shot real bad through the corners, and having to
work really hard to get around people getting dropped...so I might have
done better had I been in the group to start, but that race really
kicked my ass.  Looking at the power data, it appears that I worked just
as hard in the C crit as I did in the B, though it didn't feel like it
all, that is actually really encouraging since I was actually pretty
tired doing that second crit.  Afterwards I went on a run with Andy W
and that felt good as well, but boy my legs are tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back we stopped at Red Robin, and I got a call from my Dad
and found out that he overdid it playing bball, and is okay but in the
hospital tonight.  Thinking about him has made it hard to study, but I'm
really glad that he is doing okay and may even be coming home tomorrow.
 I have a really really tough week, just bad timing...so I'm thinking
about going home for the weekend, but I'll see how things go.  Here's a

really fun.  Mark even skipped church to come out, but missed my race by
a few minutes.  We rode around campus which was fun, and I got to see
the mark-cave.  Unfortunately, NC State meal plans don't work like Tech,
so we couldn't eat at the dining hall for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was a super-tight .35mi loop on NCSU Campus, and it was a
tight but really fun.  The tight turns allowed those of us who could
corner hard to take advantage of our handling skills.  There was an
uphill straightaway, and downhill straight into a hard corner, and two
very short sections connecting the two.  I lined up front and center,
and that ended up being crucial because the first turn was wide enough
for about 3, and we had lined up 8 wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_2118" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;When Kevin said go, I didn't wait to clip in my other foot and just
pushed on the pedals through the first corner.  I then took a second to
clip in, and it was just me and one other guy.  I realized we were
already ahead of the group, so I hammered as hard as I could down the
hill into the very very fast turn 3.  We took that corner suuuper hard,
and I knew that there was no way the field could keep up.  We kept going
as hard as our legs would go, and a few people caught on.  The laps only
took one minute, and because it was so tight they were pulling lapped
riders out of the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three laps in, we'd lapped half the field and they were taken off of the
course.  For the next 20 minutes, we sprinted up the hill every lap.
 With 10 to go, Kevin realized he had forgotten about primes because he
was too busy pulling riders, and we had our first prime.  I sat on the
back for the sprint for that prime.  Then with 5 to go, another prime.
 Feeling good, I sprinted hard for it and took second. (they had me in
third...but I'm stickin with second, I even gave a bike throw! jokingly,
though).  We took it easier the next lap, then with three to go, ANOTHER
PRIME.  I ended up on the front, and pulled hard down the downhill.
 When we came out of the corner onto the uphill, the group sprinted
around me for the prime, but I didn't have any sprint in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/crit.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/crit-300x141.png" title="crit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got a two bike lenght-ish gap, and I wasn't able to make it up with
two laps to go...so I finished with a strong sprint, about 100m behind
the leaders.  It was a really disappointing finish for me personally,
having been in the break (created it?) and not manning up for the last
two laps.  We'll see how it goes this coming weekend at William and
Mary, I'm feeling good about it.  Oh, forgot to mention I did finish
5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got in a hard brick workout (2x harding, 20min run) with Grayson on

starting the race, and I was excited.  I wore Nick S's helmet, with a
video camera attached...but didn't get it turned on to actually record
any of the action though.  I did steal some powertap hub batteries from
Ben W's wheel, though, and got power data! Here's a quick look at the
ride.  You'll be able to see 5 laps, the second of which Will M rode
really hard on the front for most of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crashes kept Austin and Zac Cates from really getting any of the action,
unfortunately though.  But Andy W and Jake A fought hard and caught up
with the lead group which I was in, several times.  Nearing the end of
the last lap, another attack was launched...and I still felt strong but
my legs cramped.  I felt great the whole race, so it was somewhat of a
bummer, with only three miles to the finish.  Luckily, Andy W went on to
podium with 3rd in the race! Congrats Andy on your first race! Jake also
kept up with lead group on that attack, and was somewhere between me and
Andy...I don't know about places yet.  I had to stop and stretch my legs
because of the cramping, but was able to get back on the bike and hold
off the chasing rides to finish behind the lead group...fifteen-ish?&lt;/p&gt;

something I intended to finish.  That was before I realized about two
weeks ago that if I do finish what I'm in now, I'll be one class from
graduation.  I found out today that Dr. Laubenbacher will be getting his
grant renewed for another three years, and so it is looking very likely
that I will be in Blacksburg this summer.  And so I'd take my one
remaining course during the first summer session...and be done with
undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has all been dumped on my pretty quick, and I'm looking at taking the
GRE's pretty soon so that I can start looking at graduate schools.  At
VT, there is as program that my research advisor, Shernita Lee, is in
and it sounds pretty awesome.  Not so hard to get into,
a guaranteed stipend for two years, and a Ph.D. in 5 years.  I could, in
theory, start this fall. And then I would be coming out at 26 with Ph.D.
done.  It's called &lt;a href="http://www.grads.vt.edu/academics/programs/gbcb/"&gt;Genetics Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
(GBCB).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the type of other graduate programs that I would be
looking for...I would definitely want something interdisciplinary.
 Straight math is abstract and very very difficult to get at PhD in.
 Applied math is out there, and would be something I would be looking
for at the minumum.  At VT, there are other applied mathematics programs
as well such as ICAM and ICTAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one that just popped into my inbox right as I am typing:
&lt;a href="http://www.rit.edu/emcs/ptgrad/_program_detail.php?id=58"&gt;http://www.rit.edu/emcs/ptgrad/_program_detail.php?id=58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GRE's can be taken anytime...and Shernita said they send scores to
five schools for free right after it, so I would in theory want to know
where I'm interested in going by then. By the end of the month, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot on my plate right now, to think about.  Where I go to grad
school, and even more specifically who I research with will have a
profound impact on my future opportunities and where I end up in the
long run.  I learned that in my Human Origins class...where these people
making big discoveries gained their knowledge and developed their
careers was under important people in their field, which positioned them
to become successful.  Over the course of history, that has been the
case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to chill tonight, I haven't gone out hardly at all
because I've been working so hard.  There's a bike race tomorrow
morning, then I may be going over the Ben B's to see an all-grain brew.
 Then a potluck at Will and Stephan's tomorrow night, and Super Bowl
Sunday!! Jason from the tri team is having a super bowl party, and sent
it out to the listserv earlier this week...and I acidentally hit reply
all, telling him that I'd bring my home brew keg, whoops!! Alcohol is
definitely not allowed on those listservs, as soon as I realized I'd
sent it to everyone, I had like a mini oh-shit sweat rush over me...but
it was okay, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, later!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Found</title><link href="/2011/01/24/found/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-24T23:17:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-01-24T23:17:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-01-24:/2011/01/24/found/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I unknowingly lost my hokie passport today on Harding Ave, but luckily

Kristen F found it, and dug the interwebs to find and email me! I just
wanted to thank her, and share the story because it made me think about
how accessible all this information is... Although I am pretty hard to
find without sharing my VT account (on VT-stalk as some people call the
vt.edu people-search engine) and without having a Facebook, which I
deleted this semester as one more distraction, it was possible to find
my email, phone number, address...all with just my name!  I'm proud of
my number one google ranking for "andy reagan" searches, and it helped
save me \$20 (paid for the website for two years!).  I think that some
people would worry about having that information accessible, and maybe
I'm naive, but I'm really not bothered at all that someone who can
navigate the web can look me up, I think that in itself is pretty
harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the email correspondence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;K: Hey...&lt;br&gt;
I found your Hokie Passport on the side of the road...&lt;br&gt;
Did you cancel it and get a new one? or do you need it?&lt;br&gt;
Just let me know!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Kristen, thanks so much for taking the time to email me!  If you
could drop it off in the lost and found in Squires next time you're near
there, that would be perfect.  Thanks again!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;K: Sure- no problem... It was on the side of the road on Harding Ave,
just to let you know...I have class at 9:30 tomorrow, so I will drop it
off either before or after it. By the way, it was really hard to find
your email address because you aren't on the Student Look-up thing.Haha
anyway, no problem! Should be there tomorrow!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Awesome, and it makes sense that it was on Harding, I live up
Harding and bike to class.  Sorry that I was hard to find though, how
did you find me haha?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;K: Haha well I googled you and found your Linkedin and Twitter but
there wasn't an email so then I found your website, but your email
address wasn't anywhere, and I couldn't find your Facebook. So I had to
creep pretty hard and I found your resume and it had your email. Haha
Don't judge. It worked :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me: Wow, I'm impressed!  Yeah I have a really hard semester, so deleted
my Facebook cause I would spend an hour a day procrastinating on it
lol.  And I'm not sure why my VT stuff doesn't show up.  Sounds like it
just became a challenge to find me haha but don't worry I don't judge,
I'm glad you could find me!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;K: Haha yup... and that makes sense... I'd hope someone would do the
same for me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Etc...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I finished my numerical methods HW, so I'm not just procrasting
right now either. Check out one cool little code I wrote, it saves me
work:&lt;/p&gt;

they leave, after a long a trip the last thing any of us wanted to do
was clean.  The biggest problem was the heaping pile of dishes in the
sink...and we were trying to think of ways so that this doesn't happen
all the time.  I did all the dishes, and vacuumed the floors, and told
Dave and James that was the last time I was doin that shit.  We needed
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sort of joke, I told them what my Dad said he and his roommate in
college did when they had the same problem with dishes...they put away
everything but on dish per person so if you needed it, you had to clean
it.  Dave actually took to that idea, and that's what we decided to do.
 After two days, it's been working perfect aka no big pile of dishes
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually like it a lot now, because rather than having cupboards full
of dishes and glasses, there's just one and it's easy.  Here's a picture
of our cupboard now, and the delicious venison chili, and a berry pie
Emily made.&lt;/p&gt;

for research positions this summer.  Perhaps the hardest question
(besides the open ended essays) was race.  Wait what did he say? I said
race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C2B2 (Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels) application
contains gender and race as optional questions.  Virginia Tech's
Modeling and Simulation in Systems Biology program doesn't ask.  They
just have a link to survey that is not part of the application, just for
data.  For VT's MSSB, when I filled it out this morning, I chose not to
answer.  If I chose to put them in, the truth for both would be Male and
White.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at Tech's equal opportunity statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/va-tech.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/va-tech.png" title="va tech"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to me that the only way to enfore such a policy is to not
even &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at any of those categories.  Now look at the bottom of
C2B2's application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application2.png" title="c2b2_application2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So,
they're committed to &lt;strong&gt;equality in education&lt;/strong&gt;.  But then why ask these
(optional) questions in the middle of the application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application.png" title="c2b2_application"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They're
there to serve the second part of the that statement.
&lt;strong&gt;"Underrepresented students are encouraged to apply."&lt;/strong&gt; Well to me,
that's nothing short of saying that they have a better chance of getting
into the program.  How is that promoting eqaulity between the black
female and me, the white male.  She's more likely to get in, based on
race.  Definitely &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;
equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty confident that if I submitted the application as a black
male, they probably wouldn't find out.  I mean how would they? Until I
got to Colorado and we're all white... And it's tempting, but is it
ethical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it's lying.  I'm not telling the truth. But is that wrong even
if the reasons are right? Those reasons being that if they truly were
pursuing equality in education, as a "black male" I shouldn't get extra
consideration than the white male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm ready to submit, already requested an official transcript be sent
there...and am probably going to not answer those questions.  But who
will know?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Bicycle Safety</title><link href="/2011/01/12/bicycle-safety/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-12T15:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-01-12T15:39:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-01-12:/2011/01/12/bicycle-safety/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since seeing the TED Talk by Mikael Colville-Anderson the case to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;

Mikael Colville-Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of takeaways.  Without getting too "radical" and
suggesting that we take a rational look at car culture (which is killing
43,000 and costing \$436 billion annually, promoting a sedentary
lifestyle, paving the area of ohio and indiana combined in the past 30
years, and each American consuming/burning 435 gallon of oil/yr)...rail
is by far the safest way to travel.  Bicycling can be made to look more
dangerous than driving, or safer.  But I think a point is missed.  It's
not that the biking is dangerous, it is that autos are dangerous to
cyclists as well as themselves, other motorists, and people walking.
 I'm not sure I like the dehumanizing term "pedestrians."  Safety aside,
biking is the clear winner for health, for sustainability, and for
livable cities (50% of the surface area of most cities is paved,
combined parking for each car at 2500sq.ft./car).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I've got for now, and certainly I am very hypocritical in
denouncing car culture here, and driving home.  My excuse: weather?
daylight? Doesn't matter really.  But I am trying to bike more miles
than drive this year...and hey, that's a start.  With plentiful, cheap
oil...living in a built environment designed from the road up for
automobiles...it's tough to fight back or opt out of this system.  And I
don't really plan on it, it's beyond my control.  Closing
thoughts...I'll bike or walk whenever I can since it is good for me and
is not unreasonably unsafe, and I'll have to let some of the information

Build CUS 2010, and had a great time.  I was also excited to travel
there via train, and ended up going both ways on Amtrak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I packed up my one small bag, and my sleeping bag into it's stuff bag on
Thursday morning.  Del drove me to the train station, and I got there
about half an hour early.  The station in Syracuse is right over behind
Carousel Mall, and I noticed that there was a lone bike in the rack
there.  I scanned my printed page at the quick-ticket thing and it
printed my tickets in about 5 seconds, much easier than I thought.  The
quick-ticket machines were located right in front of the main doors.  I
wandered over to some seating that was closer to the tracks, where it
looked like other people were waiting.  The station was small, so I
assumed that everyone else there was also going to NYC.  I watched the
time pass, found the train station on foursquare, and eventually put on
a cd.  I was rockin it old school he CD Player and big headphones.  The
time which the train was supposed to leave, 11:38, came and a few
minutes passed with no train... so I asked the man across from me if he
was taking the train to NYC.  A woman sitting to my left overhead my
question and said that it was supposed to be 30 min late.  Awesome.
 Forty-five minutes later, an announcement that the train was nearing
echoed, and all of us waiting there headed up to the platform.  The
train pulled up, and an Amtrak employee looked at my ticket and directed
me toward the front of the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride was very enjoyable; I had two seats to myself and sat next to
the window.  The train is quiet, and was a very comfortable temperature
all the way there.  I read my book, listened to music, surfed the web on
the Droid, napped a little, and looked out the window to passing houses
to pass the time.   All the way to DC, I was updating my foursquare (and
it updates twitter and FB) so that my parents could follow the journey.
 The view from Poughkipsee to New York along the Hudson, as the sun was
setting across the water, was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Penn Station at 6:30PM and I had an hour before my next
train left for DC at 8PM.  After getting off, I looked for escalators
that went UP and eventually ended up outside in the crisp darkness,
staring up at the tall buildings and lights of the city.  I then wished
that I had planned better for a place to eat, and set out to find a
little pizza place or something like it.  A google search on my phone
revealed that the nearest brewery was a 15 minute walk, and I set out
that direction but decided not to risk going all the way in only 1.5hrs.
 In retrospect, the train did not leave early nor would it, so I
could've went there.  But, I was all by myself in the big city and the
only person I could blame if I missed it would be myself.  I stopped at
a small pizza place called The Bread Factory, and had some awesome
pizza.  I ate super fast though and was really worried about getting
lost in the station and missing the train, and rushed back to Penn.  I
still had 30 minutes to watch the board, but was OK with that.  We
boarded at about 10 minutes before 8PM, and off to DC we went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride down to DC was nice, and I fell asleep on the way, waking up in
Union Station! I passed right through Del's hood in Philly, and there
were some beautifully lit houses along the river, but I wasn't quick
enough with the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out how to calculate the fares, I took the Metro to
Sharif's apartment.  He was coming back from dinner at Caroline's and I
saw him walking from the metro station, perfect timing! He had to work
in the morning, and I was tired from my travels, so we both went to bed
soon.  Sharif was amazed that all I brought was that one bag, he of all
people should've understood how BnB teaches you to pack light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I went for a run through the embassy district, by the
zoo, and to the National Cathedral.  I was awaiting the rest of the
CUS10 to get to Sharif's from the Metro for awhile after my run, giving
me time to shower and to read.  I was deep into my book when I heard
steps on the stairs, and I get so into books that it was a shock to see
everyone while I was still in NJ with Teddy R.  It was great to catch up
a little, and everyone is doing well.  We went to Chipotle for lunch,
then to the zoo and hung out at Sharif's apartment and had pizza for
dinner.  The zoo was pretty cool, and free, so I'll show some pictures
of that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday I woke up early and ran toward downtown DC, straight down 16th
St to the White House.  From Sharif's, I had just headed for "the big
pointy thing" (Washington Monument, but that's how well my mind works
while running) but turned around when I got to the White House beacuse I
didn't want to miss breakfast with everyone.  It was a really good run.
 Cold out, and my right knee hurt before it warmed it, but I was able to
really cruise on the flat road.   Running on flats is an entirely
different thing than running up or down hills.  If I'm going to
keep/start running faster, I think I need to do some technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back, people were just getting up so I *unpromptedly*
hopped in the shower after doing my push ups.  Then it was little while
before we headed out to IHOP, and I went with Jen, Emily and Carboni to
put our name in.  Emily wanted to go to this vegan bakery called "Sticky
Fingers" and it sounded good so I walked there with her.  I got a
oatmeal raisin cookie, and oh man it was good.  I can't remember exactly
now, but there was some very subtle flavor that made it delicious.
 Since I'd had peanut butter toast at the apartment after my run, I
didn't get anything to eat at IHOP after we waited 30min for them to
seat all 18 of us.  I would've liked a couple eggs over easy, but I
can't pay \$6 for that...when I could buy three dozen of the eggs
they're using for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating, a group of people took the metro out to Georgetown to
get tattoos and some of us stayed at the apartment for a little while,
since it was going to take a while and there isn't anything else to do
there except shop.  It took them about an hour to get there, and their
tattoos were so expensive that only two people ended up getting them,
Will and Britt.  I tried to talk the others at Sharifs into going
downtown, since I wanted to see the mall and maybe a museum or two while
in DC.  I was talking to Katie, and wanted to meet up with her but
didn't want to leave the group behind, and after convincing people to go
downtown for a little while, I didn't think we were going to be down
there very long anyway so it didn't really make sense to meet up.  Sorry
Katie!! That night a couple people went to the grocery store and we made
pasta and salad for dinner, which was good.  But here comes the bad
news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were out at the museum, I got word from Alyson that he car
wasn't fixed yet.  And it wasn't going to be, until Monday at the
earliest.  Not her fault, but I was left without a ride unless I wanted
to hope they fixed her car Monday and miss work that day.  I looked at
the train, and since it was the next day, it was expensive.  My options
laid out like this: wait till Monday with a good chance her call will be
fixed (but uncertain), 3AM train, 5AM train, 11AM train and an 8PM
flight.  The transit options went 120-140-160-218 in order of time....
dang.  I got my ticket early enough on the way down that it only cost 75
after a AAA discount (the discount required early booking).  After
mulling over the decision all day and night, I decided to catch the 3AM
train back to Syracuse.  I really hated having to make the decision, it
stressed me out like nothing else.  Sometimes plans have to change
though, and I need to be better at going with it.  With the 3AM train I
figured that I would save the \$40 of the later train, and just say
goodbye that night before everyone went to bed instead of in the
morning.  Sharif let me print the ticket on his computer, and after
saying goodbye...I was so glad to see people again, I'm going to miss
them...I headed to the Metro.  Having a lot more confidence on public
transit after the ride down, the ride back was a breeze.  DC's Metro is
really nice, and I felt completely safe riding out to Union Station at
2:30AM.  I even met a really nice woman who saw my sleeping bag and had
been looking for one like it for 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trains I was taking back were different, because neither of them
ended at my destination, and I wasn't trusting the Amtrak people to wake
me up.  So I didn't sleep well, but it was OK.  One of the times I did
get some sleep, it was in such an awkward position that my back and
right knee hurt were sore for most of Sunday.  I txted my parents and
let them know I was on my way home, and my Mom picked me up from the
station.   It was right next to Carousel, so we went there to bother
Kyle and worked, and I ended up getting a pair of jeans from Hollister
and my Mom found a rain shell for running that she was looking for.
 Kyle introduced me to the 99 cent bean burrito from Taco Bell, and with
enough hot sauce they weren't too bad.  One of the
biggest disappointments on the train home was that Moe's wasn't open in
Penn Station at 7AM when I was there...so I had to settle for a donut.
 I made sure to get a Krispy Kreme though, because I might be trying to
eat of dozen of them &lt;a href="http://krispykremechallenge.com/index.html"&gt;on the
clock&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was the trip, and here are some more of the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; is really awesome, and I'm
definitely going to have to go eat there sometime.   Then that night at
the home of the best tenders in the world, I ordered something other
than tenders for the first time ever at
&lt;a href="http://www.tullysgoodtimes.com/"&gt;Tully's&lt;/a&gt;.  Their veggie quesadillas
weren't tenders, but were really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first, I also biked to downtown for the "&lt;a href="http://centralny.ynn.com/content/top_stories/528582/resolution-run-held-in-syracuse/"&gt;Resolution
Run&lt;/a&gt;"
putting my bike into an early lead with 13 miles.  But, weather turned
more sour and I haven't been able to ride since, and have since racked
up 70 miles on the car.  &lt;strong&gt;Current score 70-13 car&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FYzTjwIdD61z-ymbXa9Sb_jZiTEFC2TkvP-stw%3BFa0IjwIdeQFv-yFseALhPxhrQg&amp;amp;q=from:+4352+clark+ter+marcellus+ny+to:+bass+pro+shop,+auburn+ny&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=47.569986,56.689453&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=11&amp;amp;saddr=4352+clark+ter+marcellus+ny&amp;amp;daddr=bass+pro+shop,+auburn+ny"&gt;Driving to
Auburn&lt;/a&gt;
to exchange a sleeping bag put in a big dent, but it was worth it.   I
exchanged to 10 pound, 0 degree bag that my parents gave me for a &lt;a href="http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/sc-gear/cats-meow.html"&gt;2lb
10oz. 20 degree North
Face&lt;/a&gt; bag.
 Sleeping in it the past few nights on my bed, I haven't actually been
too hot which is slightly discomforting.  It will get put to the test
soon enough though. All I need now to be ready for backpacking is a
camping stove, and they had those at &lt;a href="http://www.basspro.com/homepage.html"&gt;Bass
Pro&lt;/a&gt; but I wasn't ready to drop
\$100 without a trip planned.  I'd also need a tent...unless I want to
use &lt;a href="http://www.campist.com/archives/eno-singlenest-hammock.jpg"&gt;my
hammock&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/FEET-COVER-TARP-CANOPY-HEAVY/dp/B002AQ84VE"&gt;a
tarp&lt;/a&gt;.
 Dave has a tent and the &lt;a href="http://www.rei.com/product/709000"&gt;same stove&lt;/a&gt;
I was looking at, so I could probably borrow those if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I lost the challenge of not consuming Anheuser-Busch or SABMiller
pretty quickly, finishing off the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabst_Blue_Ribbon"&gt;PBR&lt;/a&gt; that I bought on
the 31st before going out on New Year's Day.  Pabst is independent, but
it's brewed by Miller... I still have not purchased from either of those
two yet, and so my challenge has taken that route.  Current status:
&lt;strong&gt;purchasing boycott successful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training-wise, I did the 13 miles biking and 5 miles running on the
first, and ran last night (4th) in the woods for something like 5-6-7
miles.  Tonight, I'm going to get on the trainer and try to pack before
going out downtown, I'm really excited to ride the train to DC and for
the REUNION tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A year in review: 2010</title><link href="/2010/12/31/a-year-in-review-2010/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-31T11:22:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-12-31T11:22:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-12-31:/2010/12/31/a-year-in-review-2010/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been told that every semester, we emerge a different person.  In

this past year, I've accomplished as much as I could've ever hoped and
definitely have been changed as a result of the experiences.  Most
notably, I am two semesters closer to graduating college, which is both
amazing and very scary.  This summer, I biked across the United States
and that is a great accomplishment, especially doing it while being able
to help others.  I came into the year with a girlfriend, and am coming
out without one.  This past semester, beer has definitely become at
least a hobby and I took up running for my first triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Spring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the spring, I made some important decisions and raced
bikes for the second season.  Most importantly, I made the decision to
become a mathematics major, and outlined my decision here:
&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/2010/03/26/math-or-chemical-engineering/"&gt;http://andyreagan.com/2010/03/26/math-or-chemical-engineering/&lt;/a&gt;.
 Racing, I was doing very well in Men's C, but got into a big crash and
never got back into form...posts from all the races are in the archive
on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in some very hard classes that semester as well, and was
undertaking the VT Cycling clothing order.  That order stressed me out
more than anything, and was basically a complete disaster with the
clothes coming in for our last race of the year.  Reaching out to alumni
got the order up over \$20,000 and was more than I was ready to manage
at the time.  And the Organic SynTech lab was probably the single most
awful class I've taken, it was an incredible amount of work in the lab
and although I got to use NMR and HPLC and MS, I won't need them in
future.  I finished the last semester of Earth Sustainability,
culminating in our Community Bike Ride action project.  The project
wasn't a success, as we ran into opposition from every party including
the New River Valley Bicycle Association and the Blacksburg Police
Department.  That class has really shaped many of my views, and without
it I wouldn't be doing many of things that I do (like going vegetarian
in 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, I had the most epic summer imaginable.  A physical feat
that most can't even imagine, I completed with relative ease.  Biking
across the country with CUS2010 is definitely going to be an experience
that shapes me for the rest of my life, and I'm getting even more
excited to see everyone in DC in a week!  There are countless pictures
and stories from the summer on the right in the archive, I'm not going
to attempt a recap.  A few of the things I learned are that there are
awesome people all across this nation (screw mass media), our bodies are
capable of much more than we know, and I love bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall, I raced mountain bikes, learned an incredible amount about
beer both in and out of Brewing Science class, did my first triathlon
and had one of the most fun 3 months I've ever had, still managing to
emerge with a 3.66 and do undergraduate research.  Living on my own in a
house with two other guys was an adventure all it's own, and I love it.
 I definitely would not want to live by myself, but having the house is
great.  A memorable moment was when I was using the angle grinder on a
machete on the front porch (making lots of sparks and noise at 11PM),
Dave was hanging upside down playing his harmonica, and James was baking
shortbread in the kitchen all at the same time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family drove down to Jean's in West Virginia for Thanksgiving and it
worked out perfectly.  There's some posts of the awesome meals that Jean
cooked us.  I wasn't ready to come home when break started, I was having
so much fun playing the snow in Blacksburg, but I've enjoyed my time
home a lot so far, although it's nearing an end already! Break wasn't
too much of break really, going out late most every night and working
full time since the day I got here...but I am writing at OBG right now
:-P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's a year.  I'm going to write an update on my resolutions now!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Christmas update</title><link href="/2010/12/28/christmas-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-28T12:06:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-12-28T12:06:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-12-28:/2010/12/28/christmas-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I laid out my options for going back to Blacksburg.

 I've decided to stay in Syracuse and work through that last week, going
down to Bluebell with OBG, and then driving to school Monday 1/17 from
Bluebell.  So this upcoming New Year's weekend will be my last weekend
at home.  Below is what I've been up to the past week and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Training&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training for the upcoming racing season hasn't been spectacular,
although I've done some hard workouts on the trainer, and two days ago
went on a 4.5mile run with my Mom...but working a full day really makes
it too hard to ride when I get home.  For example, I should try to ride
tonight before the &lt;a href="http://blog.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2010/12/orange_scouting_report_provide_1.html"&gt;SU
game&lt;/a&gt;
and going out after, but I'm going to pick up &lt;a href="http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/2123007610.html"&gt;a
fixie&lt;/a&gt; after work so
I won't get home till 6, and won't have time to eat, ride, and shower
before heading up to the game.  Tip is at 9, but we're going to get
there early to see warm ups and make a night out of it, since this is a
bigger Christmas present for our family.  It doesn't look like a trainer
ride is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Christmas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Christmas, I was really happy with how my gifts came out,
and with those that I recieved.  I filled Kyle's book-safe flask with
some good Scotch, Mom's ice cream maker is fully functional and we'll
get to try it out very soon, and my brewery tour for Dad tomorrow is
shaping up.  Tim, from &lt;a href="http://www.empirebrew.com/"&gt;Empire Brewing Co,&lt;/a&gt;
is going to show us around the brewery which should be awesome.   Then
we're going to hit up the other two breweries: &lt;a href="http://www.sudsfactory.com/"&gt;Syracuse Suds
Factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://middleagesbrewing.com/"&gt;Middle Ages
Brewing&lt;/a&gt;'s tasting room.  The &lt;a href="http://www.brooklynbrewery.com/beer?id=17"&gt;Brooklyn
Brewery Winter Ale&lt;/a&gt; holiday
5-pack, which I gave the tour brochure to him in, was delicious as well.
 I got some new Keen winter boots, &lt;a href="http://www.showerspass.com/catalog/men/mens-jackets/mens-club-pro-jacket"&gt;Shower's Pass rain
jacket&lt;/a&gt;,

Uncle Carl's birthday card and I'm sure there are at least a few things
I'm leaving out.  Not really a present, but the guy at Verizon
warrantied my phone and so now I've got a new DROID as well, which I
wasn't expecting and am really happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Partying!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Zdanowski's birthday on Christmas, and last night we went out
downtown.  I'm beginning to learn my way around Syracuse's bars as well
as the restaurants which we walk to for lunch sometimes from O'Brien &amp;amp;
Gere's awesome new &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=o'brien+and+gere&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hq=o'brien+and+gere&amp;amp;hnear=Syracuse,+NY&amp;amp;cid=0,0,12583811927136777963&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A"&gt;downtown
location&lt;/a&gt;.
 Syracuse is a actually a really fun city, despite the cold and snow.
 And it's not really even that cold here when it's in the teens, often
Blacksburg is colder.  Sarah drove both ways for Zdan's birthday, in
what was possibly the most uncomfortable car ride of my life with Dan K
on one leg and Dan Z on the other, crammed into the tiny back seat.  The
way home was better, I laid across the back seat on top of Del Dan and
John as Zdan held his head out the front window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resolutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new year, I've decided to attempt all three challenges below and
so I'm going to lay out the reasons I'm doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bye bye meat: becoming vegetarian&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Sounds as simple as can be, just cutting meat out of my diet.  This
is only possible now that I do eat enough fruits and vegetables that I
can sustain myself on them, I used to be far too "picky."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 1, the earth: Since the very beginnings of my education in
sustainability, and culminating with the semester of Earth
Sustainability focused on food (including the tour of Joel Salatin's
Polyface Farm), I've learned about the connections that we all share
with our food and how that affects the world we live in.  Zeroing in on
the meat-eating of Americans, we eat more meat, more often than has even
been eaten in history.  Its rare that we know where that meat comes
from, and there are some figures that I find particularly alarming.
 Around 70% of the antibiotics produced in the US are fed to livestock.
 The number of calories that we feed to cows, in the form of grain which
they can barely digest, is 20 times what we get back in terms of meat.
 This grain is almost always corn, producing the "marbled" fat in their
flesh, and their waste is not given back to farms.  Instead, the massive
farming operations rely on fertilizers and pesticides derived from oil.
 There's a big disconnect in this system.  In performing a personal
carbon analysis, the food I eat results in more carbon emissions than
driving (#2) or heating/cooling the house (#3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 2, health: Simply because I don't see the effects on my
waistline, I often eat way too much food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Biking miles &gt; SOV miles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple enough, I'm planning a repeat of putting more miles on two wheels
than on four in 2011.  I'm counting all the miles I bike (for
transportation, recreation, racing) against the miles that I put on my
1999 Honda Accord.  I'm going to reset my "Trip B" odometer in the car,
and keep an excel spreadsheet of miles biked.  My Mom pointed out that I
without a doubt did this in 2010, with my cross-country bike trip.  The
big driving miles that I do are to/from Blacksburg and Syracuse, and in
2010 I only did two one-way drives.  Back to school in the Spring, and
back here in December.  Lauren drove me to the start of my trip, and to
school in the fall from NY.  The only other significant drives were
to/from Chapel Hill and to/from Parkersburg, both from Blacksburg.  Only
400 miles round trip each, and with 1200 Blacksburg-&gt;Syr miles, that
puts me at 2000 miles in the car.  And I'm sure there is quite a bit of
miscellaneous mileage, but I primarily bike around school.  Consider the
4,000 miles I biked during the summer and all those I put in the Spring
training and racing, and this fall training...no question I got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would I try such a foolish thing? For starters, cycling is an
active, safe, and healthy mode of transportation that is not going away
anytime soon.  Commuting actively means that I get some exercise going
to class, get there much more quickly and with much greater flexibility.
 It saves money on gas, although that money that is likely spent on bike
upgrades and lights, going entirely carless would save heaps
in maintenance and insurance.  In our oil-dependent society (my
lifestyle as well depends very much on foreign oil), and the fact that
sooner or later we are bound to have burnt through this
greatest-of-resources that we've ever stumbled across.  Our use of the
oceans of oil beneath Saudi Arabia is without doubt irresponsible, and
to develop a real energy alternative to maintain the "convenience" of
driving to work from suburbia is not happening.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;Anheuser-Busch Imbev and SABMiller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2011, I'm saying NO to bland, multinational beer.  This shouldn't be
too hard, really, yet I have to decide whether this means buying those
beers, or consuming them altogether.  There are some downsides: could
possibly be more expensive (but I don't think it will be), doesn't work
as well to buy craft beer for a party (and those who wouldn't appreciate
it), and what to do for drinking games?!  The positives are definitely
better though: discourages binge drinking/overconsumption at \$4.50/beer
at the bar and \$2/beer in the store, favors the local instead of the
multinational and puts
&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/2010/10/14/strange-brew-an-update/img_3631/"&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;
before &lt;a href="http://www.budlight.com/"&gt;BL&lt;/a&gt;, and I could go on for hours but I
can't explain it any better than the movie &lt;a href="http://beerwarsmovie.com/"&gt;Beer
Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which I think you'll need to watch to
fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Empire Brewery</title><link href="/2010/12/26/empire-brewery/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-26T11:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-12-26T11:30:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-12-26:/2010/12/26/empire-brewery/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Tim of Empire Brewery gave my Dad and I a tour of the

&lt;p&gt;The tour was awesome.  We got there and had some delicious burgers while
we waited for him to finish cleaning up from brewing a double batch, and
then went back to see the inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how much I should divulge, but I don't think it's a hidden
secret that they capacity to brew 7 barrels, and have 7-7-7-14-14
barrel fermenters.  He brews double batchs of the two most popular
(sadly, the lightest two beers, but they are both very good...the flavor
of the Skinny Atlas really shocked my Dad and I for a light beer) into
the 14 barrel fermenters, and the other ferment the other beers.  Tim
really gave us some great information about how he came to be a brewer,
how the brewery operates, and what it means to be a small craft brewer
in 2010.  He's really nothing short of an artist, and his craft has to
suit all of those who come to the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can't say enough about the tour, we walked away with 2 pounds
of local hops, and samples of NY grains, a growler, and bellies full of
great beer.  An all around awesome experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A busy break!!</title><link href="/2010/12/21/a-busy-break/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-21T00:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-12-21T00:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-12-21:/2010/12/21/a-busy-break/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Really, so much for a break at all.  After finishing my last final on

lounging around watching football wasn't the kind of break I think I

&lt;p&gt;Break is going to fly by real quick now, each weekend being planned out
already. This coming weekend is Christmas, which should be great.  And
then it's New Year's weekend.  After that, I'll be headed to DC the
following weekend for the Bike and Build reunion which I'm really
excited for.  And then it's either heading to training camp or coming
back for more work, and a work trip to Bluebell for that last weekend.
Then school on Tuesday!!  So here are my options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Drive to DC, then continue to Blacksburg for training camp the
following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Drive to DC and back... no way jose&lt;/p&gt;

hitchhike/bike/get a ride home from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​a. Work the following week, go to Bluebell in OBG car (they're taking
one) and come back with them Sun night.  Drive down to school Monday
from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​b. Work the following week, drive to Bluebell with all my stuff.  Then
continue on down to Blacksburg Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think laying it out like that helps me think it through.  Picking
apart #1 vs #3... the money is the only reason I would work the extra
week, having already put in three weeks.  Training camp will help me
this season in Men's B, but not sure how much.  We're talking about
something like \$600 here.  That's more than two month's rent...
Tough decisions!  Since I don't really want to take Kazane on the train,
and wasn't thinking to bring fixie home, I just inquired about a fixed
gear bike on craigslist just for the trip.  It's \$200, but no doubt I
could sell it in Bburg for at least that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'll figure it all out! Right now leaning on coming back to SYR to
work, then driving from Bluebell down to Tech, if none of the people I
gave rides to need one back down.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Home for the Holidays</title><link href="/2010/12/19/home-for-the-holidays/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-19T23:31:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-12-19T23:31:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-12-19:/2010/12/19/home-for-the-holidays/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After finishing up my finals and then playing in the snow my last day in

Blacksburg, I drove home with a full car to home sweet home.  From the
time I hit the road, till the time I was in my driveway totaled 12
hours, marking the longest journey yet.  Utilizing Virginia Tech's
&lt;a href="http://www.vtrideboard.transportation.vt.edu"&gt;Rideboard&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to
fill the car and was really happy to give a ride to four other people.
 It was  a little tight, however, and I wasn't able to bring home some
of the things I had hoped so in future I hope to cap it at three
passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Katie Beatty, I was able to use a DARS report to find my
grades before they are released officially, and today learned that I
finished the semester with a 3.568.  I'm really happy with that result,
having had an awesome semester outside of class as well.  Needless to
say, I got an A in Brewing Science.  Here's a link to that final paper:

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I start work at &lt;a href="http://www.obg.com/"&gt;O'Brien &amp;amp; Gere&lt;/a&gt; again,
and it will be good to see my friends in IT again, the new office, and
make some rent money over break.  My Mom is going to drop me off
tomorrow on her way to work, and I hope to bike there at least once this
break.  The route biking there is only 11.7 miles and seems actually
pretty reasonable, taking back roads all the way there (Dad click

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about some personal challenges for the coming year,
and a few of them are to (1) put more miles on two wheels than I do in
my own car (2) boycott the multinational bland beer or (3) join my
brother in going without meat once and for all.  The most obvious
obstacles that occur to me are getting home without a car, which at 600
miles would certainly be an undertaking, and I will be putting myself
600 miles into the hole driving back this spring.  The beer challenge I
like a lot, but it would certainly be as painful on the wallet as it
would be pleasurable on the pallet.  And going vegetarian may be the
easiest of the three, except for &lt;a href="http://www.bullandbones.com/"&gt;Bull and
Bones&lt;/a&gt;' pulled pork platter so close down
in BBurg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures from the trailer contraption I towed around
Thursday night in BBurg and of the Reagan Christmas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode around campus and Chapel Hill which was cool to see.  It's
another beautiful campus.  In NC, they are about two weeks behind
Blacksburg, with many of the leaves still on the trees.  We stopped and
laid in the arboretum, it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we headed out to the countryside, and rode to the country store at
a dairy farm for fresh homemade ice cream and milk!! It was soooo good.
 I had a scoop of maple and of vanilla, in a homemade waffle cone, YUM.
 And I couldn't pass up the half gallon of chocolate milk, so I got it
in a grocery bag, and put my arms through the sleeves to ride home with
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out further for some more miles, and I saw a familiar jersey
heading the other direction, a Bike and Build jersey! Adam had done a
trip before, and knew Ral and Laura, and turns out he's going to be
living next to them next year.  He rode with us, and I pushed on the
pedals a little bit on a few rollers with him, those are the bigger
efforts below.&lt;/p&gt;

scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to leave early Sunday, and headed up to Roanoke to pick up my Mom
from the airport! It's a nice drive, with some winding country climbs
and descents that made me want to get the bike outta the back seat.  The
timing worked out perfect, and I got to the airport just after she got
her baggage, and I could only hope Dave and James had left the house
clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did, and my Mom approved of our house this year.  It was really
warm out, and to take advantage of the weather we hopped right on bikes
and set out to ride around campus and to Christiansburg on the
Huckleberry trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After \~16 miles of riding, we were back in town and Mom treated me to
Cabo Fish Taco for dinner, and a seasonal stout from Highlands Brewery
to top it off.  We decided that night to go on a hike the next day, the
two I knew of being Dragon's Tooth and McAfee's knob.  After poking
around online, we read that McAfee's was the single most photographed
spot on the whole AT and it was an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to bike out, and it was such a gorgeous day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hike was great, and the view INCREDIBLE.  SW VA is gorgeous.  From
the top you can see all the way around, even into Roanoke Valley and see
the city nestled in the valley.  Pictures do little justice, but here
are a handful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back and went to Bull and Bones for dinner, which turned out to
be a perfect choice.  Head basketball coach Seth Greenberg was on the
radio live when we got there, and after we finished eating went over to
see Frank Beamer talk.  Everything was great: the brewhaus chili, cheesy
mac n cheese, bbq beans, pulled pork with all four sauces, the IPA and
the stout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night Kati came over and we all watched &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078902/"&gt;Breaking
Away&lt;/a&gt; streamed via netflix through
the xbox, and it was a really good movie.  Thanks to &lt;a href="http://mydailyground.com"&gt;Brett
Sherfy&lt;/a&gt; for the tip that it was on netflix
streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday we took the opportunity to sleep in, and I went for a ride with
Bill while Mom went for a run around campus.  We headed out to the
river, but the rain hit earlier than predicted and we got soaked.
 Luckily, Bill was prepared enough for the both of us and let me borrow
his rain jacket, it was a huge life saver because I was comfy with just
a jersey to start, but once I got wet the wind made it so cold.  We rode
real hard, here's a lookski:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/11_23_10_power.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/11_23_10_power-300x148.png" title="11_23_10_power"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For
dinner, we ate some of the many pounds of cooked pasta in the fridge,
and it was good after sitting in sauce for a few days.  Then Kati came
over with some of the pumpkin brew and we all hung out for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, Mom and I again took advantage of our vacation, and slept in.
 It was still rainy, and I didn't feel like riding because I was a
little sore still, and so we went for a 5 mile run together.  My calves
were real tight, and we stopped at one point so I could stretch.  The
run was also hillier than my Mom is used to, it's impossible to run
without going up or downhill nearly the whole time in Blacksburg.  From
the top of Clay St, we took a right into some development, and there
were so awesome views of Ellett valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our run, we didn't waste much time and I loaded up my bike to
bring to WV.  The drive to Jean's house went well, without any stops.
 Not long after, Kyle and Dad got here and we were all back together for
the Thanksgiving holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

race.  It was a lot of fun, and I felt great.  After three hours of hard
riding, and a poorly executed attack, I finished THIRD in the Men's B
race.  I was riding with just a jersey and shorts, and by the end had
the jersey all the way unzipped, the weather was AWESOME.  Both the day
before and day after the race I was riding in just a jersey and shorts
too, love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will and I were leading most of the way out on hills Mt Tabor road, on
the first hill we went off and splintered the race pretty well.  After
we turned back onto Harding, some of the Rogues guys who had been
sitting on the back attacked, and their teammates were blocking but I
wasn't going to bother going after them anyway.  Jason D and Tyler G
took off and bridged up to them, but I never feared that the four were
going to stay away.  The way back on Blacksburg Rd we took it super
easy, and then started rotating toward the end before the climb up
Harding, and the climb up Happy Hollow.  Still feeling awesome, Will and
I went hard up Harding and even harder up Happy Hollow before getting
caught by the A's on Tabor.  We all stuck with them, and I was pulling
through most of the time.  Chris and Will were right up in the action
too.  They weren't going particularly hard, (looking at the power below,
see how the second time on Tabor was easier), and we caught the group
that had attacked.  Keeping a strong pace onto Blacksburg Rd for most of
the way back, it was coming to a finish.  Since Will and I were the only
ones pulling, I decided I might as well go a little harder and attack
about a mile from the climb.  I asked Will how his legs felt, and he
said he was feeling a little tired, but I went ahead and attacked
anyway.  If he just stuck on, the move should have helped him out by
getting others to chase.  John Delong had been sitting on the back to
let the B's race it out, but nobody chased me so he did, and then others
joined in (including Chris B and Andy W).  It didn't take too long of me
hammering out front before I was caught, and then the VT B squad was
dropped by the A's right at the base of climb.  I didn't realize that a
B, Yarik, was still with the A group.  All of legs were tired, and we
climbed Harding with all we had.  It was painful after 60 hard miles,
and to my surprise I actually beat Chris to the top, but couldn't keep
up with Andy W who went on to take second.  At the top, I about
collapsed, sprinting in for third.  Chris was right behind me, and Tyler
came up after a bit.  Then we saw Will and Jason and everybody, and I
didn't hang around for the A's to do another lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy W and I went on an important mission to recover the Owen Cup trophy
from the display case, and a volleyball tournament that crowded War
Memorial created just enough diversion for us to sneak it out.  It's a
really awesome trophy, and to see Ben King's name on it, with his recent
national championship, being signed by Team Radioshack and racing in the
TdF next year, was inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went over to Lefty's for the post race get together with people,
but this year's winner Owen Nielson wasn't there to sign the trophy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after the sweet SAYG ride on Sunday, I went MTB'ing with Ritchie

really hard for, and was worried about, but I was the first one done!
That felt good.  And tonight...goin to hunt some books, then tomorrow
heading to Carrboro to visit Ral, Laura and Mark!! Stayin there for the
weekend, then my Mom is coming down for the first half of Thanksgiving,
and we're going to WV to spend Turkey day with Jean, which should be
really good.&lt;/p&gt;

me at the Chapel for our ride.  Whoops, missed my alarm!  He came to the
house though and good thing, borrow some leg warmers, and I shoveled a
bowl of cereal down and off we went for our bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted the ride as 80-100 miles, but we picked a 65 mile route that
Will had done before.  Heading out Den Hill and over to Alleghany
Springs turned out to be a beautiful ride.  We had thought it was going
to be freezing, the temperature was in the low 40's, but it wasn't bad
at all.  There was one big climb on that road and it wasn't too bad, it
was a very rural but super smoothly paved road.  Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still feeling some legs on the climb back up Ellett Rd, I sprinted and
took the Blacksburg town sign, for a 3-2 win on signs.  On the way back
through town, I grabbed a pair of delicious apples at the farmers market
and made a half pound of pasta with breyer's vanilla for dessert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I had a chance to get much done besides shower and eat and clean
up, it was time for cyclocross practice.  Christian picked me up, I took
David's MTB, and we picked up Will and Stephan on the way out to
Kentland Farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some looking around we luckily found the place, despite Cole's
terrible directions.  The course turned out to be rediculous, at a mile
and half long with some major climbing.  I'm going to stand very little
chance on a mountain bike, although there is one very sketchy downhill
for which I'm glad to have front suspension.  My legs were not too
tired, but there is no relaxing up "Ig Hill," a super steep, paved,
climb on the course.  Sunday's race avoids the hill, and makes me think
that might be all I'm up for.  But I'm doing both races...hopefully I
don't slide a turn into the live electrical fence along the turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was back to the house, for the second half pound of
spaghetti, a shower and getting my running gear and stat HW together. 
Eating quickly, I grabbed everything I thought I would need and headed
over to Katie's house. Stat HW is just miserable, and never fun, be we
managed to do most of the first two (of 7 problems) before I headed over
the Stephan's for the night run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how my legs were going to fare, 12 of us drove out (I drove 6
of us) to the bottom of the gateway trail, namely "Old Farm."  Going up
it brings chills to mountain bikers and runners alike, a 1.4 mile,
600-ft climb up the side of Brush Mtn that is very technical and just
hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta run, but I finished the run up and felt great somehow.  We then
ran for another 20 on top, and ran back down with our weak headlights
and only one rolled ankle in the group, sorry Kay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt great, and actually feel like I'm in good shape.  Will M did this
whole epic day as well, and we're going to crush it on road bikes come
this spring!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I just put these up on FB, so here's some pictures!! (random mostly,
of some great meals, SPARTA, hiking, and such)&lt;/p&gt;

 After sitting a week too long in the primary fermentation, it was about
time.  I borrowed Elliot's racking cane, bucket, and tubes and went to
work cleaning the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning out used beer bottles is probably the least fun part of the
process, but it wasn't bad at all.  After that, I boiled slightly more
than a half cup of maple syrup with a cup of water, put it in the bottom
of the racking bucket, and added the beer from carboy #1.  The smell of
the boiling syrup was awesome, and brought Dave back some good memories.
 From there, we discovered that the bucket valve had a small leak and
after losing not too much beer, went to work putting it in bottles.
 That didn't take too long, we used up 25 bottles and then putting the
caps on is one of my favorite parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleaned out that carboy, to use it as a vessel for the secondary
fermentation of the other half of strange brew, with a bunch of maple
syrup.  Cleaning it out was a pain, but I did it, put the syrup in, and
racked from the other carboy.  I cleaned out that one too, for good
measure.  Airlocked and hopefully fermenting again, it's sitting in the
kitchen with my sleeping bag around it.  Right now, less than 24hrs in,
I see a bubble every 20sec or so.  Here's pictures from the process:&lt;/p&gt;

Bike Conference title right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The championship weekend at WVU was awesome, with races Saturday ay Wisp
Resort and today at Big Bear Lake state park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 5 races in total, four on Saturday and then the XC on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dual Slalom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carved into the side of the mountain was the dual slalom course, which
was really only a single slalom course after the first burm.  After a
few practice runs (which entailed pushing/riding the bike up the slope)
we all took qualifying runs and were seeded into a bracket.  My run was
pretty good, and I got seeded well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was down taking pictures next to the big jump when my number was
called though, so I had to &lt;em&gt;sprint&lt;/em&gt; to the top of the hill and get into
the start gate.  As soon as I stepped into it, Ryan asked if "riders
ready?" and I said "no!" as I was still unclipped, and my chain was in
the smallest ring, and I was completely out of breathe.  He said "too
bad" and dropped the gate.  I scrambled to clip in and shift the bike,
but lost enough time that Jan got in front of me where the courses
merged.  There is really no opportunity to pass on the rest of the
course...so I took second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty dick move on his part to start it like that, but I was
relieved to learn that we each took two runs.  What I quickly realized
though was that we switched sides, and the side that I had been on had a
HUGE advantage.  For the second run, I tried my best but could only get
my front wheel even with Jan's back wheel by the time the courses
merged, which was after only one burm.  I was inside of him on the next
burm but couldn't get around for a pass.  I continued to try to pass him
on the inside, but he was taking a pretty low line on the burm so I was
basically turning on flat ground...and after a few turns I had to get
more aggresive but with the flat turn, my wheels slipped out.  So there
went that race...I was a little put down because of how I lost it, but
oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Super D&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super d is a mass-start downhill race, and to make it even more
interesting it was a "le mann" start.  That means that instead of all
starting on our bikes at the top of the hill, we pile them next to the
start of the trail and start the race running to the bikes.  I love that
start, but had some difficulty with my sweatpants getting stuck on the
back of the seat (I was wearing them to protect my legs) so I was about
halfway back by the trail.  It's a really fast downhill race, so I
finished just about where I started, although I think my practice run
was faster...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Downhill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had just enough time to get one practice run of the downhill course,
which was fortunate.  The course went down the woods next to ski slopes,
and was pretty crazy.  There was on section that I was not going to hit
for sure, a huuge drop off.  Luckily I spotted a place to bike around it
for the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start, there was a girl with a full downhill bike and body armor
that looked pretty intense, and with just my hardtail and lack of major
downhill skills, I let her go ahead.  But with about a quarter of the
hill left to go, I had been absolutely flying down it, I caught up to
her.  She stopped to let me pass, but it  was right over a two foot root
drop and I had to almost stop too, and went over the handlebars.  I
landed on my feet, but realized that my chain had come off and my
handlebars were really twisted.  Throwing the front tire between my legs
I straightened the bars somewhat, and hopped on down the hill so I would
be in front of her.  Without the chain on, it's extremely difficult to
get clipped in because the cranks spin freely, and I was trying to get
in, the trail was taking some huge drops and was really steep.  Without
my feet attached to the bike, I got bumped off the bike on one of the
drops and flew about 10 feet down the side of a bank, landing squarely
on a log with my right knee and chest.  That really hurt.  I had got my
knee pretty bad, and my felt my chest for broken ribs, but was OK
there.  Getting up really slowly, I sat back on the bike and coasted
slowly to the finish where I laid on the grass for a good 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Short Track&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After riding the chairlift back to the top again, I only had about 20
minutes till the short track started.  I popped a couple advil, and
after 15 minutes could move my knee again.  So, what the heck, I rode to
the start of the short track race from the house.  And ah, might as well
try it, so I started the race without pre-riding the course, my knee
hurt too much.  Having not ridden the course was interesting, I didn't
know about a narrow tree gap that squeezed Jan and I together, knocking
him off the bike and into another rider.  Sorry, Jan!  Then there was a
crazy rock section, you'll have to look on FB for some pictures of it. 
It really wasn't that bad, but people were falling off their bikes and
everything.  I made it through, and eventually made my way past a bunch
of riders.  There couldn't have been too many more people in front of
me, like 5 I guessed, so I kept riding fast.  I shouted to our team
watching and they told me that Andy was ahead of me, to catch him.  I'd
already passed most of the other people on our team one at a time.  So I
kept going, feeling better the whole time and LOVING the jumps on the
second half of the course, gettin some air!! Andy was kinda far ahead,
and I couldn't see anybody gaining on me, and it was like that for a few
laps before we were done.  Turns out, he was the only one I hadn't
caught, and I got second!  Not too long after that though, my knee
started stiffening up.  We watched the other races and that was fun,
before going to WVU's house for a cookout.&lt;/p&gt;

in the swim, but bonked on the bike and suffered through the whole run,
but didn't stop to walk either.  Having 36 people there representing VT
was incredible, as we struck fear into our collegiate opponents' hearts
with a huge chant right before the start, and just so much positive
energy.  Everyone was cheering us on, and in some places it kept me
going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results aren't up yet, and I didn't bother to look after the race
because really that doesn't matter haha, I know I kinda stunk but
finished under 3 hours still.  There were 452 pictures on my camera so
it's really tough to pick just one...maybe I'll do a few haha:&lt;/p&gt;

which there is only one distance: olympic. I was scared about the 1 mile
swim, but felt I could crush the 25mi bike and would somehow survive the
6 mile run. Having signed up, I immediately started training hard,
starting with three workouts the day I signed up! Now, having swam
consistently over the past two weeks I actually feel very confident
about the swim, having had my best workout yet tonight. I went from
barely being able to swim a 50, and I couldn’t even finish 2 50’s…to
today doing a 300 warm up, 6×75 with almost no rest, 4×200 with 15 sec
rest, and 4×50 with 10sec rest (on the 60), and still felt strong but
was out of time and did a comfortable 100 cool-down. Pretty amazing how
far I’ve come, but we’ll see how it happens in the open water. On the
weekends, I’ve been beating myself up on the mountain bike, and have
been doing wednesday worlds as my only other bike ride really for
training on the bike…which I have somewhat neglected and am just
counting on base fitness really.  I haven’t been running too much
either, but did 7 miles yesterday morning followed by a long 2.5hr bike
ride.  That, on top of a hard weekend of racing and the 10+ miles I
commute every day on my fixie…my legs didn’t want to move this morning.
 But they did, and again I felt great swimming.  I’m going to take it
easy the next few days, with possibly an suuper easy bike then run
tomorrow, and then an open water swim in the wetsuit on Friday
hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, I couldn’t be more excited for this weekend.
 I’ve got all the gear, including a wet suit from Alex Brown, a race
belt and timing chip strap (that I can’t find at the moment though).  I
put the aero bars on the bike, and yesterday wore the aero helmet during
the ride…I really could’ve used more time in that position though, but
from what I hear Big Lick is hilly.  Today’s picture is all of that gear
laid out, pretty much everything I’ll be taking this weekend. (Plus the
MTB for racing Sunday at App State and some other things I couldn’t find
haha).&lt;/p&gt;

that a longer race would have favored me, really but it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride back was long, but I rode with Ritchie and drove the last two
hours so it was a good ride.  Hangin out at the tri house for a little
while, Alex Brown let me borrow his wetsuit!! And I got a number belt
for the run at Big Lick…so I have got all the gear for sure. and I’m

&lt;p&gt;The XC wasn’t super tough…somehow I managed to crash many times though
including possibly my two hardest mtb spills to date, but what I now
think plagued my riding was preoccupation (letting my mind drift too
much and not focusing on the trail), going too fast lol and wearing dark
sunglasses.  The trail being in the woods, it was shady and I wore them
because I needed to keep dust out and protect my eyes&lt;em&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;but I think they
did more harm than good.  And really on the trail requires 100% focus
out there, especially going faster than I ever have on unfamiliar
trails.  The first time I went down hard I’m not sure what happened, but
I think there was a big lip onto the wooden bridge that I failed to see
or pick up my front wheel for…either way next thing I knew I was
airborne over the bridge without my bike haha.  Even after having to
gather myself and put the chain back on, I didn’t get passed though…but
I definitely lost lots of ground on third place who I was tailing up to
the wreck.&lt;br&gt;
The second time I hit hard was when I clipped a tree with my handlebars
enough to send me flying into a neighboring tree with my shoulder.  That
hurt really good, and I got passed haha before getting on the bike and
going slow for awhile…shaken up.  It was narrow and I clipped many trees
but that was the only one that sent me flying, probably because I hit it
so fast.  Not helping matters much, my new right grip slipped off and I
rode the last mile holding on to just the narrow metal bar and I missed
a turn near the end running right through some tape haha.  Despite the
shortcomings, I managed to finish fifth I think lol.&lt;br&gt;
Short track is clearly my event, and I’m getting better because this
one was almost entirely in the woods! Pre-riding the course my legs
didn’t feel strong, but once I got on it they listened haha.  I loveddd
the course, it was super fast with a big drop, some rooty uphills and
jumps, and I pretty much mastered a fast line.  We did a “le man” start
which means that we lay down all the bikes, then to start the race
sprint to them and start riding.  I was late to the start and leaned my
bike against a table near the pile…which turned out to be quite
advantageous haha.  My legs didn’t feel like running but once we off I
was nearly first to the bikes and was able to grab my bike still running
and jump on with a considerable lead into the trail.  Later I learned
the jake who was second slid out in that first turn and had blocked the
field even more for me haha.  After two laps no one was really even
close to me which was awesome, but I almost wondered if id taken a wrong
turn lol.  I hadn’t, but the course which was super sandy made the turns
really hard, and missing one sent me slightly into the woods but not
slowing me down…but I had got a bunch of branches and leaves stuck in
the cassette and couldn’t pedal.  It didn’t come out pulling them from
on the bike, and I had to stop to clean it out…bummer.  jake, an nc
state guy, and ben rice passed me while I was stopped.  Jake had been
talking lots of trash before the race haha, so I hammered hard and with
my sweet line, caught them in two laps and then sped around on the
straight away.  When I flew by jake I gave him a pat on the back lol,
asserting my dominance in the short track, now back in first place.  I
went fast for the next while, and soon enough it was just jake behind me
and we had a huge gap.  Not before long, it was the last lap and I asked
him if he wanted to make a gentlemans agreement for the finish.  I
didn’t want to beat him in the sprint just because I had a bike length
head start from in front of him, so we agreed to come side by side,
shake hands, and then sprint! We did, and I got him, a fair victory for
sure.  The rest of our C team finished strong as well, taking spots
4-7.&lt;br&gt;
Other highlights of the day included hanging my hammock over the race
course, taking some fun pictures, and my moms zucchini bread after the
race! All the good pix are on my camera (writing from the phone now) but
I was able to take a picture of my beaten leg lol, it will make a sweet
scar if it scars.  I think it’ll show up at the top, but that’s from the
first big crash and only part of it haha, not really too bad though,
just sweat made it sting in the second half of the xc and st.&lt;br&gt;
Well that’s all I got, a (slightly longer) xc race coming up tomorrow
and I’m going to try to win it!&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday was a really long day in class, but I finished both of my

came up for the night from UNC!  Dave and I made delicious tacos for
dinner with his parents homemade salsa, my living room was a bike shop
for a while and then I took Ral on a bike ride around Blacksburg and the
drillfield by night.&lt;br&gt;
In the morning when I got back I made eggs and cheese toast sandwhiches
for a great breakfast. We hung out for a while before I went to brewing
class with the few miller high lifes left, and then packed for a weekend
of mtb racing! Id like to post the picture of our passenger van filled
to capacity haha but its on my camera. So for the pic, imagine 12 happy
mountain bikers crammed into a van haha!&lt;/p&gt;

caption="The past two weekend I've been having a lot of fun racing
mountain bikes. I've been borrowing Dave's bike, and have had to keep
fixing it up but it's working great. So far, two new tires because I
broke the back one going down Old Farm and the front one was so worn out
that I kept sliding out in the W&amp;amp;M TT in which I was wearing my TT
helmet lol so I got a new one and it helped me grip the trail to a win
at the VCU Short Track on Sunday, had to get a new chain before even
racing when the old one broke 4 times up Old Farm, got new handlebar
grips which I just got and haven't used yet but will hopefully help my
hands from hurting, annnnd new derailer cable and housing too somewhere
in the past few weeks, wow. But there is a lot more to it than breaking
the bike, the fun stuff....like riding fast up and down trails that are
super steep and have huge roots or rock ledges that I have to climb! 
This coming weekend I'll be travelling to NC State to race there and I'm
excited, currently sitting 4th in Men's C and the team very comfortably

race, and it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started out early Saturday morning with an uphill time trial (race
against the clock up a mountain) up a trail called "Old Farm."  It's
still hard for me to imagine how it's possible to ride the 2 miles up
the side of this mountain without having to get off the bike, but
apparently it is.  There are huge roots and boulders with steep grade up
to them and after them, that maybe someday I'll have the guts to attempt
riding up them haha. So it was partly a running race as well, and I
finished middle of the pack.  Immediately following the timed uphill
race is a timed downhill race back down it...but I got a flat barely
into it and ruined the tire on the back, which was a bummer.  I walked
back up to the top and caught a ride down with Ben W.  The next event
was the dual slalom, but I skipped on it and went home to get a new
tire, some tubes and see Lauren before the Short Track under the lights
that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short track race is a \&amp;lt;1 mile loop for 20 minutes, with some
sections of rock and tight turns out through the VT rec fields, and
whoever can get the most laps in that time wins.  There were about 30 of
us in the race and after a sprint to the course, this guy with a green
jersey, who had won the uphill in men's C (my category), was a little
bit ahead of Jan and I.  We rode hard for what seemed like a long time,
myself going back and forth with Jan in 2nd and 3rd.  Problem was that
with the tight corners, it was hard to go much faster than we already
were on the course, and through the whole race weren't able to make up
much time on green jersey guy.  Ben W was going to give me his
sunglasses if I won...but by the end of the 20 minutes I had to settle
for 2nd place after attacking Jan on the last lap.  Lauren had come out
to watch the race, and I was really happy to get second with her there
watching too.  Talking with Nick and John after the race got me even
more excited for road season this year haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was it for Saturday, I was super tired and just read a little bit
before going to bed...lame haha but I had a race to get ready for the
next day! Sunday morning I barely woke up in time to get out to the
cross country (XC) race, which was a 10 mile course out in the Jefferson
National Forest on the Poverty Creek Trail System.  I remembered how
hard the course was last year, but for some reason thought that I was
better now haha.  We started with a quarter mile on a gravel road before
hitting the single track, and I put in a little effort and hit the
single track with a lead on the whole field.  Into the woods on Poverty
Creek was fun, it's a hilly but not too technical trail and Matt Londrey
and Jan caught up to me.  I rode hard ahead of them for a while, and we
had to be getting pretty far away from everybody by the time we hit the
technical stuff.  Having read "it's not about the bike' this summer,
after I couldn't shift into my small ring, and couldn't clip in with my
left foot....I soon realized that out in the woods on a MTB....it often
is about the bike.  My left cleat came loose off of my shoe, and I had
to stop to try to fix it.  By the time I got the dirt out of the screws
and got the cleat back in though, everyone had caught up and passed.
 Well, there went my race...I tried to ride hard for awhile, but by then
trail was getting the best of me.  Prickly Pear is the name of it, and
it's rough haha.  It's basically like trying to ride through baby head
sized rocks up the side of a mountain, then back down, and again and
again.  My right cleat came loose as well, this time as I stopped and
tried to clip out, just the shoe turned so I fell right onto my side in
a pricker bush...and was still pulling them out of my arm last night
haha.  I somehow managed to finish, outsprinting a UVA guy at the
finish! I was pretty let down by having mechanical failures put the nail
in the coffin for my race...but that's MTB'ing.  Turns out that I wasn't
the only one who had trouble, I didn't even hear of a person whose bike
didn't break in some way on the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the race, I got Stephan to give me a ride back to my car which I
had parked at the top of the service road because it was so rough on my
car that I just stopped and rode my MTB the four miles to the start of
the race.  A bunch of us met up at Moe's and I finally used the last of
my Moe's Money from the crew 5k freshman year haha.  The burrito I got
was huge and delicious, and after endless nachos I was stuffed.  Sunday
night Dave, James and I fired up the charcoal grill and grilled Filet
Mignon for dinner, with steamed sweet corn as a side and it was a really
good! We watched Thank You For Smoking and then played some guitar hero
before I called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether it was a great weekend, I realized how tough racing MTB's can
be regardless of fitness (and how expensive because they always break),
managed to give back the pump and multi-tool I borrowed to their proper
owners and get a tube back from the guy I gave my spare to during the
race, and hopefully my ankle heals quick.  Next weekend's race is at W&amp;amp;M
and VCU, I think I might go!&lt;/p&gt;

compete in VT's home MTB race, and since my bike has been broken I've
been running and swimming a fair amount...and am looking at triathlons
but who knows if I'll do one haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Driving down/day 1 (8/19)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren and I made good time on our way down last Thursday, getting to my
house in 9.5 hours with stops.  We had just missed Dave, but James was
there to let me in and give me a key.  First walking through the house
was really weird, because it was so moved in to and foreign.  The front
yard was sprawled with scrap wood and the fridge was full of random
food, and all that was in my room was the mattress and some of James and
Daves stuff. After moving my stuff in from her car, into a pile in the
corner, we went to Mike's for dinner and then to Mary Kates for my car
and things I had stored there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My car was still stuffed full to the roof, and we put some things in
Laurens car so I could make just one more trip...so much stuff! After
letting my car run for a minute, it began to rev from 1k to 2k rpm in
idle...not good.  I was going to try to drive it home still, worried
though, and told Mary Kate that I would call her when I got home to let
her know I made it.  The way home was scary, the car creaking, revving
in idle, and complaining in general after a summer of neglect.  To my
relief, we made it up the hill up Harding to my house, I was bummed that
the car was not working though.  Lauren and I were both tired from all
day driving, and I unloaded my car the remaining floorspace in my room
and went to bed not long after, having bought new sheets at Target on
the way there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Friday, day 2 moving in&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning I went with Lauren to help her move in, and we got
checked in to The Village. It was amazing how different her living
situation is...its so clean and new, she had brand new carpet and all
the furniture is from like target haha not the home depot scrap lumber
bin. She was the first there, and after a little bit her parents got
there and I helped to move all her things in. One by one the roommates
were showing up and I helped moved them in as much as I could. After a
little while she took me back home and I started to move stuff into my
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the car was still running weird, I went to advance auto parts to
pick up oil and an air filter to change those. The guy there said that
he thought the car just needed to be opened up and driven. To get the
last of my stuff (chair, TV, speakers) and drive the car, I headed to
Mary Kates and on the way there drove the car hard across Lusters Gate
Rd. After loading it up, on the way back it was no longer revving by
hovering near 1100 rpm shakily. Up harding though, the check engine
light came on and I thought I had killed it haha. Back at Advance, they
read it with their computer and the code said I needed a new Idle Air
Controller. That make perfect sense, bc the only time it was having
trouble was idling. The part was \$200 but I needed it, so I ordered it
and it was supposed to come in on Wed. Good news was that I now knew
what was wrong and driving the car wasn't going to hurt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the house, I unloaded the car and now all of my stuff was in my
room...in piles around the mattress haha it was a mess with no desk or
storage at all yet. After that I went out for dinner with Laurens
roommates and her parents who treated us to Red Robin and it was really
good.  Got a chili burger that I had to eat with a fork and a bottomless
root beer float!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday: Burke's Garden Century and Day 3, shelf building&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up super early in the morning and rode with Greg to a flat century
that's been going on for a few years now, about 30 minutes away as a get
away from all of the campus traffic.  Long story short, I finished the
century in &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; over 5 hours, at an average pace of 19.9 MPH! It
wasn't entirely flat, there was one climb that we did both sides of, but
80 miles were at less than 1% grade haha.  Going out, I thought that
Greg and I were with the fast group when we broke away from them 20
miles in, until we got caught by Justin C and John Delong's four hour
group! They smoked by us, and I actually got caught up in their paceline
and did a few pulls at 27-28MPH ...and was recovering from that for the
rest of the day.  With stops, I got back to my house at 2PM and showered
and took a nap haha.  Then I spent the rest of day trying to get some
shelves built so I could start to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>My time home in NY</title><link href="/2010/08/19/my-time-home-in-ny/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-19T05:02:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-08-19T05:02:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-08-19:/2010/08/19/my-time-home-in-ny/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the morning, about 6 hours from now, I'll be headed down to Virginia

 I've spent right about two weeks recovering and having withdrawals from

most of my days sleeping in and drinking around a bonfire haha.  Lauren
came up on the 14th and I have really enjoyed showing her around my home
town, more like eating around my home town, and I think/hope she has had
fun too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first while I was back, I did manage to ride my bike after
sleeping in till noon every day but with playing basketball with my dad
and spending time with Lauren this most recent week, I've got a chance
to spend this past week out of the saddle.  Every day it's weird because
I feel like I should be riding, and just have the urge to ride my bike
all the time...adjusting to the real world where not every day is a 70
mile day haha.&lt;/p&gt;

some with my new 50mm f1.8 lens as well, which I really like.  So here's

by a narrow 13 second margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 8 teams in our age group now, and it was a close finish.  My
Mom ran for the second year, and did awesome with a 7:27 pace making her
the second woman over 50 yrs old! It was 151st place overall, and I was
even suprised to see her so early at 23 minutes, and congratulated her
before taking off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going out of the changeover zone is always a little scary, and you have
to go really slow but after I was out of the gate I hit it hard.
 Accelerating in a sprint to over 30MPH into the headwind, I was trying
to keep up with some guy in full aero gear on a P3.  Eventually I caught
him, and stayed with him for a mile or so before we caught a Bike and
Build alum!! I was super excited to see that jersey, and shouted "bike
and build!!" like we always did before catching up to him.  I talked
with Max for a little while, and then we got to the steeper hill and I
took off again.  I had lost the cervelo guy which felt good, and was
passing people by the truckload going up the gradual incline at 25MPH
into that headwind.  I lost steam pretty quickly though, and hung on to
18MPH over the rest of the hill into that wind before me made our left
turn.  From there, I just went head down in the aerobars and hammered.
 I was still passing people but it was thinning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew by the guy I had seen before the race on a Pinarello and thought
about asking him to trade with me haha.  I knew the course well, and
sprinted hard up the two steep little hills before the gradual downhill
to the finish.  Never leaving my big ring the whole race, I felt like I
was going to throw up at the top but relaxed approaching the second and
made it over, never seeing below 20MPH on either of them.  I could
hardly see anyone in front of me, and figured that by now I had to be
near the front.  The gradual downhill to the finish had a tailwind, and
I was going over 40MPH for a while which felt sweet.  It was not too
long before the end that I passed Mike's girlfriend, who'd had a 6
minute head start on me after Mike ran a 17minute 5k.  Going into the
changeover I sat up, and looked at my computer which read an averaged
pace of &lt;strong&gt;24.3MPH&lt;/strong&gt;without the transitions, and that felt good on this
windy and hilly course.  I was tired coming into the finish, by the time
I left the changeover I felt like I should've gone harder...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a really good feeling about how I did, since I didn't get passed
at all, and looking at numbers now had passed 133 bikers on the course.
 After cooling down I couldn't find my parents and had actually missed
Lindsey finishing, but found them after a long search at her car loading
the kayak.  It was about an hour after the race before I finally got
some water (which I hadn't taken with me) and some food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a really really long time for them to post results of the bike
leg, like three hours, but after I saw that they were up, I rushed over.
 Able to see over the crowd, I started scanning down from 10th place for
my name but didn't find it.  So, I started at the top where Parker's
name was.  He has won every year that I have done the race, and his
family's team I don't think has ever lost.  But directly below his name,
was mine!! I got second!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super excited, with the continual improvement every year since I
started leading up to this.  My dad had seen Parker finish and he was on
a TT bike, with an aero helmet, disc rear and deep front wheel...and I
(with just aero bars, no helmet or bike or wheels) had lost to him by a
mere 7 seconds! With equal gear, there is no doubt I would've won and it
felt great knowing that I was likely the strongest rider on the short
course of the 394 teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey had a strong kayak leg, I had our best biking time yet by a full
3 minutes, and my Mom had run well, and it was our &lt;em&gt;best time ever in
the race!&lt;/em&gt; Beating 2007 by 11 seconds, 2005 by 17 seconds and 2008 by 38
seconds haha.  We were third this year in our age category, out of first
by only 30 seconds...&lt;/p&gt;

spent the morning in Cannon Beach exploring the beach with Becky and

and Sarah W back to Portland with us, and everybody went to Noah's
house.  From there, we packed up bikes (I completely dissambled mine
part by part because I'm crazy haha) and said goodbyes.  After checking
in to the hotel, my Mom and I got pizza at this cool little place with
tables on the ceiling and then I got to sleep in a &lt;em&gt;bed&lt;/em&gt; for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the next day exploring Portland on a tandem bike that we rented
which was a lot of fun.  We also got to meet up with all the Bike and
Builders again which was cool.  We went up to the Rose Garden in the
hills above Portland which was nice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got around so quick on the bike that we had seen pretty much all of
downtown Portland we wanted to haha, and the next day drove out the
scenic Columbia River Gorge and did some hiking amongst the waterfalls.
 For dinner we went down to Hood River to a brewery and watched the
windsurfers before heading back to catch the plane.  A nice two days,
but I was ready to get home after the whole summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Home&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't done too much since I've been home, my days have pretty much
went like this: wake up at noon, eat some breakfast my brother made and
then go for a bike ride.  Come back to dinner my Mom made for me, then a
few hour nap in the hammock and reading my book before friends come over
and we drink some beers around a my expert bonfires haha.  It's the
life.  My first day back, I went for a 44 mile ride and climbed every
big hill in the area including Churchill road going around Otisco Lake,
and it is steeper than anything we climbed this summer!  I went down
Munro (and back up) to see how fast I could get, but only
a disappointing 54mph... And then Friday my ride was short, with the
skin suit and I just put in some TT efforts in the bars to prepare to
the Great Race this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>I Biked Across The Country Today</title><link href="/2010/07/31/i-biked-across-the-country-today/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-31T11:31:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-07-31T11:31:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-31:/2010/07/31/i-biked-across-the-country-today/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;That’s right, we did it.  All 31 riders of CUS 2010 ran frantically into

was.  After this, we hugged our parents and I am super glad that my Mom
and Aunt Becky (and Sonya and Olivia) were able to come see me complete
this journey.  And we concluded this celebration with the ceremonial
wheel dip into the ocean.  My rear wheel went in the Atlantic 2.5 months
ago, and I literally rode my Kazane into the water today.  I’m going to
talk about the (uneventful) ride here, and go back to talk about the
past three days if I have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride here was again relatively uneventful, as we inched toward our
goal.  We set out with different strategies on how to ride today, as I
was super eager to complete the journey and arrive at the Pacific but
others wanted to savor this last ride for every second.  We were going
to ride into town and into the ocean as a group though, so those of us
readier to get to Cannon Beach had to wait for the others who chose to
take a two hour coffee break in the morning and ride real slow, which
was some of the toughest waiting, but we all got there.  It was
something like a 65 mile ride today, which could have been done by 10AM
any other day but we didn’t arrive at the beach until 4:30PM.  After two
months of working hard toward completing this one goal, I’m not sure I
can say fully what it means, because it hasn’t really sank in yet
entirely.  I rode Kazane clear across the country, coast to coast, mile
for mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, after we got back and showered (warmed up) we had a picnic with
other family and friends who had come to witness loved ones finish.  I
was super hungry, about 8 hours after my 10AM lunch, and we had cold cut
sandwhiches and tons of desserts, and good beer.  I wasn’t so much a fan
of the Inversion IPA, but would definitely recommend Alaskan Amber, of
which I saved a bottle cap for my bike.  We got to meet other rider’s
family which was great, our leaders spoke, and then we had a fire down
by the water.  My Mom and Aunt left after awhile, and I spent some more
last minutes with the CUS family over beer and these really cool
mini-hot-air-ballon wish things before hopping in the van to come back
to church for the night.  Everyone is asleep by this point I’m sure, and
I’ll be saying goodbyes tomorrow at Noah’s house in Portland…&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>To Vernonia (I can smell ocean!)</title><link href="/2010/07/30/to-vernonia-i-can-smell-ocean/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-30T06:41:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-07-30T06:41:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-30:/2010/07/30/to-vernonia-i-can-smell-ocean/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we left Gresham and went through downtown Portland, into the

&lt;p&gt;Sarah C got a tandem and Jake brought it out that night, so she could
ride the last day.  I spent some time getting seats and pedals switched
onto it, and we were all really excited that she was going to be able to
ride into Cannon Beach the next day.  Hill-master Marky Mark was going
to be on the front of the Tandem pulling up the hills, and it turned out
to be a very good thing, he actually got tired!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My group consisted of Joe, Zach, Jesse B and myself.  A power build team
if there ever was one, so we thought.  We were putting up the siding,
which was pain-in-the-@\$\$ off-brand "hardy board."  It didn't cut
well, and we had to try quite a few times to make some pieces that fit
around stuff.  By lunch, we had hung a net of 0 boards haha, as we had
to take down two from the day before, but we had the hang of it by then
and made some real progress by day's end.  Lots of pictures actually!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner was at Green Dragon Brewery, and I got have two excellent
local beers, an amber and a stout.  They had door prizes, and as I was
leaving I snagged a t-shirt haha.  I caught a ride and navigated with
Debbie, Jen's Mom up to Alberta Street where there was this HUGE street
fair goin on.  It's called Last Thursday, and the last thursday of every
month people come out to sell homemade stuff, play really awesome music
all over the place, make food, and hang out.  It was about 20 blocks
long, and the streets were &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of people for every one of those!  At
the end of the night I got a ride back in the B&amp;amp;B van so I didn't have
to take the bus.  The concentration of hipsters was crazy, soooo many
bikes and bike art and fixies...and I felt like I fit right in with the
mohawk haha.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Over Mt.

&lt;p&gt;That title is actually quite misleading though, as the pass over Hood
was dissappointly easy and I have yet to be in Portland, we're staying
in the suburb of Gresham.  The ride was great up next to the mountain,
and coming way back down to good ol sea level.  Dinner was miraculous,
with ice cream and apple juice, can't beat that!  A special thanks to
Noah's parents for supplying the chocolate cake and fruit salad as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the morning with a slow packing of my bin, since I had taken
it all apart to organize and clean.  Sleeping the night in the hammock
(picture of that setup from last post) worked great, and it packs up in
2 minutes, quicker than rolling and deflating the thermarest!  Our
awesome awesome hosts in Maupin had a wonderful spread of breakfast for
us, and I ate lotsss for what had been hyped to be a challenging day.  I
filled my camelbak for the first time in awhile, and am glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our route meeting, and 20 seconds of dancing to no music that I
time every morning, and our chant to Paige, I took off with Mark and
Dave.  Jesse forwent riding with Alyson and was looking to ride fast for
the first time in weeks, so he caught up with us.  On the climb out of
the valley, we lost Dave unfortunately to a mechanical I think, and
passed just about the whole group up the climb.  Its fun to start at the
back and be able to feel the progress passing people haha.  If the trip
lasted another few months though...who knows and I might be the one
getting passed, the improvement of other riders has been awesome to
watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting out of the valley it was pretty much flat as we approached
the foothills.  Into the pine forest and we went up, gradually for a
little while.  All the time we were wondering when the climb would
start.  To our suprise, we saw a sign desisnating that we had ascending
a pass of 4000ft...I didn't notice that much uphill.  And then we went
down, and lunch was early at 37 miles.  Zach had missed lunch so Mark
and I went after him with a bunch of food, but after only a little bit
more climbing...we went back down.  Signs for a 5 mile downgrade of 6%
and the fact we were right at the side of the mtn meant we were done
climbing, and that was anticlimatic.  But the descent was awwwesome, we
went down forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought we'd went down below sea level haha so was suprised to see we
were still at 1500ft, and we kept going down.  Eventually we made it to
Sandy, and made a stop at the very famous Joe's Donuts.  Two of the best
glazed donuts I've ever had melted in my mouth and I got a root beer
float for \$1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was rolling from there, and it must be the low elevation cuz we
pretty easily cruised, without tailwind, at 24mph up and down the hills
all the way here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our host in Gresham, we got spoiled again with lots of great food,
soda and such when we got here.  And yeah dinner was good, and now were
gonna go out in Gresham.  I'm on a hot streak with hammock, check out
todays spot haha.  (I think the pictures go at the top from the phone
though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, tomorrow we got to Portland proper to build and
brewery!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Eastern Oregon</title><link href="/2010/07/26/eastern-oregon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-26T16:40:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-07-26T16:40:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-26:/2010/07/26/eastern-oregon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wpid-2010-07-27-16.24.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dayville and my 21st!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept up in the sanctuary and they didn't find me to wake me up right
before breakfast which was nice.  When I woke up, the first thing I told
Aileen was how mature I felt now that I was 21 years old.  It was a
really short day on the bike, which I rode how they had decorated it,
although it got really hot and stayed unbearably so inside at the host. 
in town, I exercized my newfound rights, by the river and it was a lot
of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept in the kitchen which was cooler and so got a refreshingly good
nights sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sentence: beautiful desert valley, huge awesome melting climb, music
at dinner, and sleeping in a real bed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maupin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we started out a tad later, waking at 6 and I won the rock paper
scissors face-off to drive to the church.  It was only like 5 blocks,
but still the first time behind a wheel in two months.  Really wasn't
that exciting though.  The best part was that when we turned on Tim's
radio we got to jam to "Dancing Queen" for that minute and a half!
Breakfast was pancakes and scrambled eggs, everything I could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving town we hit the first climb within a mile, and although I was
already with the lead group, I felt great and took off.  Flying up the
hill, I was adapting "I'll Fly Away" in my head to I'll Climb Away and
my legs didn't tire all the way up.  At one point it switched back to
where I could see people below me and I shouted to them haha.  At the
top was one of the ladies I had talked to the night before who did
international relief work and had Kristen and Alyson for the night,
taking pictures.  I stopped and chatted with her for awhile more, and
waited for the others.  They got there and then down the hill we went
together, and it was a sweet dowhill.  By the bottom it was just Will G
and I, before long though we were going up again.  The second climb
seemed to last forever, and after awhile Tio got a flat.  I waited with
him, and took the tiny villanous sharp rock out of his tire.  Mark
passed us outta nowhere, then Joe and Aileen and then Noah and Emily
waited with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he got it changed we all took off and I started cruisin, then it
was just Noah and I.  It felt good flying up again, I could feel the
first climb though.  Eventually we passed Joe and Aileen back, but knew
Mark was long gone.  After what seemed to be like 12 miles of climbing,
we reached a summit and stopped to stretch and wait for ppl.  When
Aileen pulled up, she looked to horizon and out of the desert we could
see giant Mt Hood rising above.  It was awesome and I don't know how we
didn't notice.  The mountain appeared so huge and was all snow covered,
out of the desert that as other caught up and we pointed, Tio most
memorably just screamed "Good lord!!" haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sweet descent took us into the tiny town of Antelope and to
lunch, where we had brown bag lunches complete with cold cuts from our
hosts in Fossil!  I took off with Mark and Dave, and right out of lunch,
up we went.  It ended up being just Mark and I, and at mile 40 we made
the turn onto the Bake Oven.  From here, we could clearly see three
giant white mountains...and couldn't tell which was Hood.  The Bake Oven
was hot but downhill and tolerable.  We had heard of a massive climb at
the end of the day, but as we grew closer the only mountain was that
giant one, presumably Hood, and were going downhill still.  We
approached the Descheutes River and its massive gorge, and before long
took an incredible descent down to the river level and to Maupin.  The
town was on the other side of the bridge and up the other side of the
gorge a little, which I guess was the climb there but it was nothing,
lame.  When we hit the steep descent, the hot air hit us literally like
an open oven in the face.  It was suuper hot in town, and we debated ice
cream but went to the host first.  Good thing we did, cuz they had root
beer floats ready!! And tons of other snacks and goodies, and
ac...heaven.  Dave was right behind us and before too long others
started rollin in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I then got to hammock, read, talk to Lauren, sort my bin for the
final time and now blog wirelessly from the hammocl before bed! I don't

&lt;p&gt;As a state, I really enjoyed Idaho and just today we passed into Oregon.
 My most recent tweet was incorrect though, because there is one county
in Oregon that is still on Mountain Time...and that's the one we came
into haha.  Tomorrow we will enter Pacific Time as we bike to Unity, OR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what has happened since my last blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;07/14 Idaho Falls - ID 85&lt;br&gt;
07/15 BUILD DAY&lt;br&gt;
07/16 Arco - ID 72&lt;br&gt;
07/17 Challis - ID 62&lt;br&gt;
07/18 Stanley - ID 62&lt;br&gt;
07/19 Idaho City - ID 90&lt;br&gt;
07/20 Boise - ID 38&lt;br&gt;
07/21 DAY OFF&lt;br&gt;
07/22 Ontario - OR 52&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'll try to write a little about each!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idaho Falls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Jackson, we climbed over Teton Mtn Pass, and Pine Creek Pass,
making for a hard day into Idaho Falls.  Over Teton pass, we took the
"old highway" which was the original Oregon Trail, was the highway, and
has since been converted to a bike-only path.  It takes a very direct
route up the mountain, with grade approaching 14% at it's steepest.  The
newer highway takes a nice sweeping 10% grade up the side of mountain,
of which I was a little jealous going up.  I pushed hard up the climb,
and so did everyone I'm pretty sure because there was no other way up
haha.  At the top, we could hear the first people up cheering from a
half mile away, and we had a big celebration at the top with an arm
tunnel, lots of dancing, and the haka.  On the descent, perhaps for our
own good, Mark and I got stuck behind traffic which was frustrating to
get on the brakes when we could've had our best chance at 60mph.  At the
bottom, the whole group stopped and we got world famous (presidents
pictures on the walls) huckleberry milkshakes in the teton valley.  They
were great.  The second pass was very gradual and little longer, easy to
cruise up.  Idaho Falls wasn't a great town to bike into by any means,
it had that strip-mall feel, but the awesomeness of our host made up for
that for sure.  We were greeted with food, cold water, showers,
conversation...and that was great.  They provided us with dinner that
night as well.  The four beard-off participants, including myself,
entered the final stage of the competition by grooming the beards into
some pretty awesome styles that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have lots of pictures of the beards...I'll save those for later
haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Day in Idaho Falls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked with the local Habitat for Humanity, which is getting larger
and to aid in their expansion goal of building more than one house a
year to aid affordable housing in Idaho Falls, they are focusing on
expanding the ReStore as a source of funding.  We spent the day fixing
up the new building that they acquired, which was a VAST improvement to
the current one.  There was a TV crew there (I don't know the link to
the video) but we got to watch ourselves on the news later that night
which was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/0401.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/0401-300x200.jpg" title="040"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner, the pastor had us over to his house for a cookout.  He had
the best set up for a cookout I think I've ever seen...it was perfect
with a patio, huge grills and serving places, and it was an awesome
meal.  I think I ate three burgers haha.  And when we were walking
through his garage to leave, and gawking at his PERFECTly mint 1965
Mustang, he gave Mark, Dave, Jesse and I a ride back to the church in
it! The only modification is a hookup for his mp3 player, which he
filled with 60's music and leaves in the car.  That was awesome.  And
below that, I got the YAWYD stem caps in the mail from my parents!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/2010-07-15-20.28.44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/2010-07-15-20.28.44-300x224.jpg" title="2010-07-15 20.28.44"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/2010-07-15-17.31.11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/2010-07-15-17.31.11-300x224.jpg" title="2010-07-15 17.31.11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town is famous as the first to be lit by atomic energy, and oh boy
do they pride themselves on that.  We came in to catch the first night
of their annual Atomic Days celebration.  On the way there, we passed
and took a tour of EBR-1, the first power-generating nuclear reactor in
the world.  The whole day biking was through desert, and some buttes,
and is where the Idaho National Laboratory is located where they do all
the nations nuclear research (over 50 test reactors or something).
 That's where most everyone in Arco and Idaho Falls work.  Coming into
town, we stopped our third pickle joint on the trip, this one being the
"Pickle Place" for atomic burgers.  They made their own seasoning, and
the beef was local somehow, one of the best burgers I've had on the
trip.  Also their high school, Butte, were the pirates.  Their sign read
"Home of the Butte Pirates" hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ebr1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ebr1-300x200.jpg" title="ebr1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another long day through the desert to Challis, with roads that
disappeared into the horizon.  The whole day we battled massive
headwind, with one gradual climb and a great descent.  By far the
coolest part of the day was the Grand View Canyon that we passed
through.  Approaching the canyon it looked like we were going to run
straight into a mountain, but actually descended through it and the
views were &lt;em&gt;epic.&lt;/em&gt;We stayed four miles outside of town, up a big hill,
and they Living Waters Retreat Center which was like an Oasis in the
desert.  Before climbing up there, Mark and I waited for Zach and got
some good calzones in town.  When we got there, next to the stream, I
pitched my hammock and took one of the best naps ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Kristen's 21st birthday, and we were on sweep together! After
stopping at a diner in town and singing happy birthday to her, and
Alyson who's birthday it also was (although she got slightly
overshadowed bc it was Kristen's 21st haha) with everyone at the diner
helping and two candles in two pieces of pie.  It turned out being one
of my very favorite days of riding, although slow we made it a lot of
fun and it was hard not to have fun on her birthday haha.  We spend
almost the whole day going into a headwind, uphill beside an awesome
river, the Salmon River.  It's become an attraction for rafters
recently, although the only thing going on there back in the day was a
silver mine about half way there.  It was in a nowhere town of 29
people, and had a really cool museum that we spent some time at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenery changed from desert river to pine forest river, which was
awesome to go through, and it was just really beautiful riding.  10
miles out from town, we stopped at a hot spring that went into the river
and that felt great.  It was long day for only 62 miles when we got into
town at 4:45PM, but neither of us minded.  Perhaps the best moment of
the day, maybe the week or even the whole trip, was turning one of the
many corners through the valley next to the Salmon River we had been
climbing all day, to see the landscape open before us to the skyline of
the Sawtooth Wilderness Mtns.  Stanley claims that is has the best mtn
vista in the west...and they may be just right.  To top it off, we
camped out on the side of town close to the mountains, the only thing
between them and us was a field and some trees.  I slept in the hammock,
and the stars were out of this world as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idaho City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we would find out that that night, the coldest place in the
&lt;em&gt;entire US&lt;/em&gt; was Stanley, ID.  I had slept in just my fleece blanket off
the ground in a hammock, and it was 34F when we woke up.  I couldn't
feel my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I hopped on my bike early that morning and
got an early start to stay warm.  That put me in front of the group
where I stayed all day, missing both lunches but somehow finding the
stamina to make 91 miles, 90 degree heat, and a 12 mile mountain climb
on 40oz. of water and two clif bars.  I got to the host at noon, the
same time that sweep made it to the first lunch 30 miles in.  Mark got
there a couple hours later and I woke up from my passed-out nap, and ate
a ton of food haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize at the time, but putting myself out in front of the
group by so far was a poor choice in terms of safety, although I am a
strong rider....and for this, the leaders put me in the van for the day
into Boise.  So I didn't ride, but with a tailwind and mostly downhill
ride, Mark made it to town in less than two hours &lt;em&gt;including lunch&lt;/em&gt;.  I
was really let down about not riding, and wrote some angry blog posts
that won't ever make it andyreagan.com, but after a while I got over
that...when we heard the news that really shook up our trip, and every
Bike and Build-er, past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paige Hicks, a leader on the P2S route, was struck by a truck and
killed.  I'm not going to elaborate, but you can read about her and the
full letter to the BnB community here:
&lt;a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9188/1/"&gt;http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9188/1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip was very shaken up, as you can imagine, and we spent all night
in prayer and comforting each other.  We have learned how strong the
Bike and Build family truly is, which has been beyond amazing, and all
of thoughts and prayers go out to her family and the riders she led.  We
took a video the following day, along with many other things we have
done, called &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98hge31D82U"&gt;Bike and Build
IS&lt;/a&gt;.  We'll be sending
notebooks to her family and the trip, and are wearing tye-dye yarn to
symbolize that we now are riding on for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, many of us also spent the day off coping with this loss
as well.  I enjoyed the sleeping in, and spent most of the morning doing
things on the computer and planning the end of the trip with Mom.  After
that I walked around town for awhile, got a milkshake, and then came
back to make dinner for the fourth night in a row on dinner crew.
 Heather shared her recipe for her &lt;em&gt;award-winning&lt;/em&gt;grilled cheese, which
won the Tilamook grilled cheese competition her first year in it.  They
were the best grilled cheese I've ever had, I think most of the group
shared that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ontario, OREGON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-two miles after a rest day is nothing for us now, and so today was
definitely an easier day.  My legs were sore, but after stretching at
mile 15 I was all good.  A lot of farms on the way here, including the
Idaho University's experimental ones which seemed...interesting.  We all
waited for everyone at the state line, and with the two people we had
met who were biking across the country for fun who were really cool, to
take a state line picture with everyone in our last state!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/105.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/105-200x300.jpg" title="105"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the sign looked like a trainwreck though.  I forget again what
they're called, but these little thorns gave just about everyone on the
trip flat tires.  Mark, earlier, and flats in both tires at the same
time! Somehow I managed to luck out, I think the record was Emma with
three flats.  And then in town at McDonald's, Kristens tire did the
weirdest thing ever, it got like pimples haha hard to explain but really
crazy.  She managed to ride it to the host somehow before it got flat in
the parking lot though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner tonight was spaghetti and salad, which was good and since then
I've had time to talk to Lauren for a long time for the second night in
a row which has been really nice.  Also got to take out and fix
Raleigh's fork, read some of a book, and now blog! Although I've only
got three hours to sleep...but I'm sure there will be more time to sleep
when I'm not biking across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;84 miles tomorrow to Unity, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Pinedale, and JACKSON Wyoming!</title><link href="/2010/07/14/pinedale-and-jackson-wyoming/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-14T01:49:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-07-14T01:49:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-14:/2010/07/14/pinedale-and-jackson-wyoming/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;These past two riding days have been challenging and beautiful, and

&lt;p&gt;Going to Pinedale, home of the Mountain Man and the Mountain Man Museum,
was a 101 mile day and a strong headwind for the second half of the ride
made for a long 7 hours on the saddle. On the ride, it seemed as if we
came out of the desert into the Rockies again. On our right for most of
the day were the Wind River Range of the Rockies, and ahead of us in the
distance stood the jagged snowcaps of the Teton Range. It was a Sunday,
and we had just missed out on the Mountain Man festival taking place
that weekend, but did get to see some PC (Period Correct) horse and
buggies leaving town as we came in. Perhaps the most interesting thing I
learned was that mountain men (how many times can I type that) didn't
actually have big beards like my own, but rather clean shaven so as to
resemble their customers, Native Americans.&lt;br&gt;
I spent most of the night doing the group's laundry, it was my turn on
trailer crew and with Heather and Jen we did 31 people's laundry from
three days in less than two hours. We still got to see the sunset, which
was very pretty and by the time we got back, I had just enough time to
clean my bike before going to bed for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into Jackson Hole I rode with my team for the photo scavenger
hunt, and Sharif was sweep so our team stuck with him and we did a sort
of "group sweep."  The ride in came up to the rim, and then down through
the Hoback Canyon to Jackson Hole.  It was a beautiful ride, next to the
river in the canyon was perfect.  There was a 5-6mi section of really
rough dirt/gravel, and it got my bike all dirty after I just cleaned it
last night :( and the headwind coming into town was sooo strong, that
canyon was  like a wind tunnel, but after a second 7 hour ride we
prevailed.  Our host is the Ambler family, who heard about us through
their church and has put us up for four years now.  Their house is
beautiful, next to rolling pasture with cattle and horses and right
below the Teton Mtns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our day off, I got to sleep in which was excellent, then take a van
ride through the park to see BISON!  Jackson is really cool town with
shops and outfitters and a cool brewery and bike store.  I got some cool
stuff including a new cycling cap, a glass, a camping hat, and bandanna
to keep my neck out of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a 95 mile day and we were glad to have a host church in Vernal,
the Rec center for showers was incredible, and we did have to make our
own dinner again but it was good.  Zach and I also got to tour the
natural history museum for free which was really cool.  There was a map
of all the rock formation showing the morrison formation which is one of
the fossil richest in the world, heading out north we biked by all of
them including that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Flaming Gorge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading to Flaming Gorge was a sizeable climb but I felt great and kept
up with a semi for a few of the 7 mile climb. The descent was not as
epic as hoped, our campsite was halfway down it but I decided to descend
the whole thing and then climb it bc I was feeling just great and loving
how awesomely awesome the gorge is haha, and I was feeling the extra 6
miles of mountain today though. I came out with an extra 9 miles for 46
total, camping was really nice and although I got my hammock up, all the
tarps were used so I didn't want to risk sleeping in it so I tented it
for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rock Springs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utah desert was so beautiful that we were all sad to leave it today
coming to wyoming...we went through so quick! Today there were some huge
hills, really long, and no rest on the downhill with the headwind.  A
last minute direction change put mark and I in charge of chalking the
way in, which we did but it was confusing still so after we got to the
church we went back to rechalk and send ppl the right way, get wendys
and I picked up some rock and roll lube. All for a total of 92 miles. 
Put it on tonight so we'll see how it goes. Our hosts here at the first
congregational are phenomenal, provided us with showers in their homes
and a tremendous dinner, and I've heard rumors of breakfast!we had our
first bike clinic tonight and I explained the workings of a derailer
which was fun, and then I read my book which I one click bought through
the kindle app on the droid, and am gonna mentally prepare for the
century tomorrow by means of sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

research a town so we could learn about the town, interesting things to
there, and the affordable housing cause in the area.  I was given
Maybell, CO and Vernal, UT (today and tomorrow) and so I'll first share
a little bit about Maybell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population 370, 95% white, 139 of 193 homes are occupied with an 80%
ownership, and interesting things in town are (the only things in town
are, literally) a general store, library, restaurant, and gas station. 
It's a popular destination for bird watchers and solitude seekers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really there isn't much here, in the way of entertainment or cell
phone service, but the restaurant was good and the folks at the library
here are very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was halfway through writing that the ride today was for the most part
uneventful, but now I remember haha, about 30 miles into the 73 mile
day, I blew the sidewall out on my rear tire! Bang! And the tire (and
tube) were done for.  It was Mark, Dave and I at that point, and we had
averaged 21MPH and no tires we had.  So we called the van which couldn't
have been too far ahead since it just passed, but since it was an easier
day we weren't that spread out so she didn't really have time to turn
around to get me a tire, I had to wait for sweeps.... So we decided to
ghetto-patch the tire itself, and I put in the whole patch for a tube
(with the metal wrapper0 that had some strength, and a new tube. 
Pumping it up the first time, the tube was popping out of the sidewall
where it had busted, but deflating it, taking the tire back off and
moving the patch got it to hold!! By that time, some people had passed
us, (Laura was only a minute behind us by herself..she was cruisin), and
Will Paradis actually had two spare tires with him!  I thought that the
patch we had made was actually pretty strong, so we decided to ride that
out till lunch and it did hold, even with glancing the rumble strips a
few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At lunch, Will said that I could take one of his tires as long as I get
him a new one when we can, which I did and now I'm rockin a 25C on the
back (slightly wider) which I think is a good chouice on his part.  I
had about exactly 800 miles on that Gatorskin before it blew out...bad
luck I guess.  I chowed down on three PBJs and we headed back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only got 5 mintues before we head out, but in short the terrain
changed to desert basically, we stopped and swan in the Yampa a few
miles out of town which was nice, I set up the hammock under a tarp
which I'm excited about, and we're camping in city park.  It looks like
it's about to thunderstorm like crazy in about 5 seconds out there, dark
and really windy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta go, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Steamboat Springs!!</title><link href="/2010/07/07/steamboat-springs/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-07T01:36:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-07-07T01:36:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-07:/2010/07/07/steamboat-springs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In one sentence: The ride here yesterday was great, I really enjoyed the

one climb and big descent, Steamboat Springs is an awesome bike friendly
town, and the day off today was perfect.  The internet here is useless,
so I'm going to try writing from my new phone so hang tight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking up where I left off, we got to see fireworks the night before in
Kremmling and I got some pics that I think will come out pretty cool. 
Playing with sparklers and long exposure is always great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was our first night camping and oh boy it was cold, I think it got
down to 15 at night and without my wool socks it would've been a
stretch.  Getting up and around in what couldn't have been more than 30
degrees was hard, but once we got going it wasn't intolerable.  I tried
to stay warm with everything I had on, and hopped on the bike and
starting spinning away as soon as I was ready.  I headed out by myself,
and after 5 miles started to warm up a little I stopped to take off my
sweatshirt that was under my jacket and some pictures of the morning
that was beautiful despite being tad crisp.  Kristen caught up while I
was stopped and we got to ride together for a good while which was
nice.  There wasn't a whole lot to see, just hills and every mile there
was a small billboard for "F.M. Light &amp;amp; Sons" about cowboy hats or boots
for the whole family haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one big climb on the way, just before halfway of our 60 miles,
up and over Rabbit's Ear Pass.  I crushed both up and down the hill and
it really felt great.  I caught and passed pretty much everyone in front
of me, and at the top where the continental divide was, I met four Tech
grads who were meeting up for the first time after graduating together
in 94.  They were dissappointed to hear that their streaking ritual was
no more and that Pritchard, where they had lived, was now coed! It was
neat getting to meet some fellow Hokies, Hokie Nation alive and well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going down the pass was something like 7 miles at -7% grade, so I
thought it was going to be a bnb speed record breaker but there ended up
being a strong headwind which held us to just over 50MPH...sad haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got in the first thing I did was stop by the Verizon store to
get a new phone that I needed desperately to stay in touch with Lauren,
and I went with the Droid by Motorola.  So far I love it so much...so
many incredible features, though I still need to get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group we went out in town at night, which was fun because there
were some cool places but we didn't stay out very late at all.  For our
day off, I got to first sleep in, then walk to a diner for french toast
which was great after not having it all summer!  Then Noah and I suited
up to go rent some mountain bikes from the Ski Haus which was one of
three cool bike shops in town.  We were super excited to rent some 29ers
(29 inch tire diameter bikes...bigger wheels) and ride some of the world
class singletrack, but after we sped the two miles there, they were out!
Big bummer...so we decided to go check out on of the other shops.  I'd
been to Orange Peel earlier and they seemed pretty chill and turned out
that they had bikes to rent! And they were 29s! I rode a Kona and Noah
rented a Moots, mine was mid level at about 1500 retail and I got it for
the two hour rate with a big discount bc we're bnb for 17 which was
sweet.  The Moots was a titanium frame with X9 and went for 5500, so he
paid a good chunk more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riding was just insanely awesome, some of the most fun I've had on
the trip, rippin up the trails up and down the mountains.  I got some
scratches and covered in mud and it was perfect.  There were some
breathtaking views from the mountains we climbed, and I loved just
running over everything on the mountain bike.  I enjoyed creek crossing
of the cool clear stream we rode up with that I had to try hard not to
drink haha, after sinking the bike over the bottom bracket in mud but
even with the crossing, rock gardens and steep section I never had to
unclip so I impressed myself a little.  They told us just to bring them
back before close which was sweet and we rode for a good three hours
before takin them back...sooo much fun.  I'm definitely mountain biking
more this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got to mail some stuff home so I now have space in my bin
finally, got a sweet deal on a smart wool shirt across the street, ate
dinner made by us which was good stir fry and then go to the hot
springs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost filled a printer paper box with stuff, which I used because I
didn't want to do flat rate because that goes priority which I don't
need.  And they charged \$3 for the ready post...what a rip haha.  So I
got it all organized and shipped for \$15 which I was happy with and in
time to check out the 50% off smart wool sale going on at the outdoor
store across the street.  Got to use my cell phone app that reads
barcodes and uses gps to do a local product search and it works perfect
and in like 2 seconds I knew that I had a sweat deal.  I got a medium
weight base layer and I'm excited to use it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot springs were like 7 miles away, and since pretty much everyone
wanted to go we did van shuttles out there.  It was super relaxing,
there were both hot and cold pools and I used them both to help recover
my legs after some hard riding today.  A perfect way to cap off our day
off, and now I'm hittin the thermarest to be up in 5 hours!  I just
wrote this all on the cell and the real keyboard is definitely the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we partook in the tradition that is Bike and Build Prom, by
decorating the gym of our elementary school host not unlike many of our
high school proms.  We were still at 8,000 feet so we did our best to
stay hydrated, and it was a lot of fun.  I'm pretty sure because of the
day's ride, everyone was out by 11PM still.  My date for the prom was
Raleigh, and everyone was looking pretty ridiculous, see the pictures
below haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we slept in before our ride (for the first time ever!) and left at
noon for our shortest day yet: 27 miles.  I joked about going for the
"hour challenge," to get to our host in less than an hour, &lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; we
got out on the road and were nailed with a 20mph (gusting over 40mph)
headwind.  Pedaling just as hard, it took us 90 minutes to get here, and
I think everyone made it in two hours somehow.  I got an excellent shake
and buffalo burger in town here in Kremmling, and we're excited to see
the fireworks tonight for the FOURTH OF JULY! Yeah 'Merica!!&lt;/p&gt;

days and today!! Now the post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride today was beautiful beyond words, riding into and through the
Rockies.  The elevation profile that I posted yesterday was a little bit
misleading as for grade, the first two hills were super steep and the
giant hill was really gradual until the end.  Looking at it now makes
sense, but it was hard to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate breakfast with the Men’s Breakfast that the church has on Friday
mornings, and I got to talk for a good while with two awesome guys who
were excited about my trip which was really cool.  The casserole for
breakfast was awesome again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two hills of the day which don’t look bad on the elevation
profile were really steep and killer!  The group I went out with caught
up with everyone and we all kinda split up.  By the time we hit the big
gradual hill I thought it was just Jesse and I out front, but Mark was
ahead of us we realized at the top.  There were a lot of cyclists out,
and the climb to Ward (mile 21) was apparently a pretty famous climb for
the area.  It was fun passing lots of people going up, the elevation
didn’t seem to be bothering us at all.  A few miles into it, a guy
passed us and so I caught up to him.  We got to talking, his name was
Terry, and he was pretty awesome.  He had biked the country self
supported in both directions, the second time carrying only 13 pounds of
gear, and had through hiked the Appalachian Trail, Continental Divide,
and Pacific Crest Trail!  Said he had lived in Boulder for 20 years now,
he worked in optics and most recently worked on the 3d glasses for
movies, which was cool.  It was neat getting to talk to him up most of
the climb, he knew a girl who rode a unicycle across the country!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top was the town of Ward where we thought lunch was supposed to
be, but it was a mile down the hill after the crest.  Ward is a small
hippie town, and we met up with another cross country cycling trip
called 4K For Cancer which was neat.  Our ride is more organized for
sure, and it was cool because we’re both biking for great causes.  I
went into the general store there because I had heard about it at
breakfast that morning, and they had real Coca Cola! So of course I had
to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking in toward the snow capped mountains and riding right next to them
was surreal.  We saw Long Peak Mountain which stood at over 14,000
feet.  We stopped for a little bit along the way just to try to soak it
in…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At mile 44 we began descending into Estes Park from &gt;9,000 feet, and
flying into town on the side of a mountain with an awesome view of the
snow capped peaks right next to us was beyond words.  Emily and Kristen
cried it was so beautiful on the way in.  It was probably the single
most beautiful 5 minutes of my entire life, I can't even describe.
 There were no words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In town, I stopped and ate pizza with Jesse and Zach at this good place
Jesse knew, got a deep dish cheese and it was pretty good.  From there,
I saw Heather and Jen and Alyson get into town and we went and checked
out the Stanley Hotel.  It’s where “The Shining” took place, it’s a
fancy hotel really, and they have ghost tours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our host tonight was a high school about 5 miles out of town that is
also an anomaly.  The campus was way out in the mountains with a
gorgeous view on 640 acres, and turns out that it's a Honda sponsored
boarding school that serves to help struggling high schoolers across the
nation and as a lab for new teaching methods! Students apply, and the
estimated \$40,000 yearly tuition is covered by Honda and they spend a
minimum of two years, the first 25 days are a wilderness retreat and
it's a pretty sweet school.  I found out at about 11 that they had
internet, and got to post this that I have been writing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I've put together elevation profiles for the next three days for
the group and got closer to getting pix up for the past few days but
unlike the first line haha I don't think I'll finish, it's midnight now
and we have a big day tomorrow on Trail Ridge Road.  I'm going to save
the elevation to put at the top of that post, but it looks like one big
uphill to the top, and one steady downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh almost forgot to mention that today, I snapped my front derailer
cable! I couldn't shift into my big ring (which I don't need uphill
anyway) and had to just coast down hills for the remainder of the ride.
Since I didn't need the derailer without the cable, at lunch I took the
cable out and decided to take the derailer off so it wouldn't rub in the
cross ring gears.  I broke my chain by hand to take it off and put it
back together.  For the next few miles it was shifting like crap, and
the chain broke while I was riding! I stopped, and very luckily the
master links had stayed on, or I would have been out a chain.  I put it
back together better this time, and was good for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok well that's all for now, goodnight!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Boulder, CO</title><link href="/2010/07/01/boulder-co/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-01T18:57:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-07-01T18:57:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-01:/2010/07/01/boulder-co/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leaving Denver was quite an adventure when I realized in the morning

that I didn't have my sunglasses...because I remembered that the night
before when my hat had blown from the steeple to the roof of the church,
my glasses were on it!  Here's that story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like need my sunglasses to see haha I have wimpy eyes, and so I went
around the church to see if they had like blow down.  The hat was lying
beside the gutter, but no sunglasses.  So they were either still up
there, or had come down and someone nabbed them.  I wasn't going to
leave the church without them, so I attempted to scale the rock wall of
the church to get up to the roof...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was unsuccessful, I got halfway up but couldn't find
any holds, and went to ask Jen and Heather if they remember my glasses
being on the hat.  They didn't remember but Jen did rock climbing so I
asked her to come look and see if it was possible haha.  I tried again,
and had to shimmy between two walls and somehow got up on to the roof!
My glasses were up there!! Coming down was even scarier but I didn't
fall haha, what I didn't realize until later though was that in the
process of holding myself up with my back and hands, I crushed my cell
phone that was in my back pocket completely....dang!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it though, and since I didn't really like that phone
anyway, I would definitely rather have my oakleys.  My biggest concern
was that I won't be able to talk to Lauren on the phone until our next
mail drop, but it turns out that my next upgrade with Verizon is in
three days!! After talking to my Mom and Dad about whether they were
going to ship me one, or if I should use the upgrade, we worked it out
and I'm just going to get a new phone on the 3rd! I looked at what
Verizon has got out there, and it's basically down to the three android
phones. The Droid, the Droid Incredible and the Droid X but that last
one doesn't come out till July 15th, so I'm not sure I can wait.  What I
hated about the storm, besides it's totally unreliability when I wanted
to talk to people, was that it didn't have a real keyboard.  The Droid
is the older, and less feature-rich of the three phones (the other two
boast 8MP cameras-almost as much as my SLR, 1GHz processors-faster than
top of the line desktop computers 5 years ago, and the Droid X has a
4.3inch screen and takes HD 720P video), but it has a keyboard.  It's
going to be a hard decision haha.... I do hope that the iPhone really
comes to Verizon in January though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The ride to Boulder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Denver I was a little late, knee bleeding and phone crushed from
finding my glasses haha but I got ready as fast as I could.  The
directions were crazy, but there were two Bike and Build alumni and the
lady from IMA of Denver, Donna, who organized the fundraiser the day
before and that was going to lead us out.  We didn't leave with the
whole group, so it was just the last four of us, and we reached a pretty
crazy intersection.  Right then though, Anna and Sonya the alums had
come back to help us find the bike path that we were supposed to be
getting on.  Getting to it was confusing for sure, we wouldn't have made
it without their help but one we were on the path it was absolutely
gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denver is super accessible by bike, we had ridden the B-Cycle bike share
bikes the day before all over town, and the path that we were on felt
like being in a forest, next to a beautiful river but looking up were
skyscrapers because we were in the middle of the city!  We called the
big group, and they waited up for us and then we rode as a group of 35
down this path out of town.  I really enjoyed that riding...Denver is
just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hit a main road that we were supposed to take to another bike path,
and it was confusing since we didn't have cue sheets but I just followed
everyone else.  I didn't leave with the fast group but then left with
Jen Hock who is a speedster haha.  We rode along and eventually we
caught up to Aileen and Rob, who worked with the Anna and Sonya in the
bike shop in Denver and raced for 1st Bank.  It was cool getting to ride
with someone at an "endurance pace" which was moderate but so smooth
that it reminded me of riding with Reid because he had the powertap and
stuff too.  We cruised along some beautiful roads and caught up with the
fast group after not long.  At the pace we were going, I could feel the
lack of air at 5,000ft for the first time when we crushed up some hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we rode, we got closer to the mountains and we were right at the
foothills of the Rockies.  I didn't take any pictures of that, because
pictures honestly can't do it justice haha.  It took longer than we
thought to get into Boulder, and we thought that the group was meeting
at a bike shop outside of town before going to the church but that had
been called off apparently, and then we rode to the host.  The shop we
had stopped at was really new and clean, but I forget the name haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pearl Street, beneath the Flatirons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drag in Boulder is a pedestrian (no cars or bikes) street named
Pearl Street.  Looking to the west, the Flat Iron mountains loom
overhead, and are just beautiful.  The street reminded me a lot of a
bigger Ithaca Commons, and turns out that they were actually designed by
the same person, I was on to it haha.  At night, there were a lot of
cool things going on like people playing music, concerts pretty much
every night, and performers doing all sorts of tricks and things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Building with the Flatiron Habitat for Humanity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we spent all day building in the dry heat, with the sun beating
down for our longest day yet.  We started building at 8am after a 5ish
mile ride there, and didn't stop (other than lunch) until a little past
4pm.  I worked with Jesse and Will Green framing walls and putting them
up, and doing lots of other jobs that involved hammering and cutting
wood haha.  They gave us a presentation about what they do after a
thorough safety overview, it was really cool and they worked us all hard
for the full day.  I can't imagine trying to find work for 31 energetic
volunteers on one house, but it was four-unit and they sure did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boulder is a really affluent town with an AMI of \$85,000, and the house
that we were working on would sell on the fair market for &gt;\$400,000
and it wasn't that big.  The whole day though we could see the Rockies
above us, and Boulder also is one of three cities to achieve the League
of American Cyclist's platinum rating.  There are something like 300
miles of bike and pedestrian trails, and there are bike lanes on like
every day.  The whole time we were working I saw people speeding by on
really nice bikes, it was sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner tonight was delicious Lasagna, and I think I'm going to watch the
movie Bicycle Dreams which is about RAAM I think and hit the hay.  I was
to organize my stuff and ship some things home as well...we'll see haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we climb! Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride shouldn't be that bad though haha, it's going to beautiful and
I am BEYOND excited for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pictures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kinda failed and didn't actually take any pictures on the ride there,
or during the build day because I forgot my SD card.  So Jen was nice

Denver, CO and the riding has been spectacular.  Our stop on the way was
supposed to have been Akron, but was actually 24 miles out of Akron, and
the church was 5 miles from the nearest building! The closest town was
Anton, population \~40.  Riding into Denver was beyond words, seeing the
rockies rise out of the horizon as we got within 50 miles gave me
chills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding to our host Sunday, in "Anton," we crossed the state line into
Colorado but not much changed in terms of scenery.  In fact, it was the
flattest and most open we have seen yet.  I was sweeping, which means
that I was one of two riders that rides at the back and makes sure
everyone gets in.  It was a long day to sweep, at 87 miles, but Jen Hock
and I gave everyone a head start and had a great day riding.  The first
82 miles were straight on route 36, and then we turned left at the town
of Anton and went 5 miles into nothing to find the church.  Jen and I
were caught up with Jesse and Alyson by the time we took the left, and
we saw the van at the store on the corner so we stopped.  Turned out
they had some delicious chocolate milk! We met an older man named Larry
who was biking from Denver to St. Francis that day as well, which was
cool.  We got passed a couple times by these huge things, and I think
they are the bases to windmills! I'm impressed that he made the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding into Denver was just so amazing and seeing the rockies rise out
of the horizon after weeks of riding through plains gave me chills.
 Getting closer we could see the skyline of Denver below the rockies,
and rode right into town.  I love the city, and we had a good dinner of
Lasagna after getting shuttled to showers, hung out with some bike
mechanics, and then went to a Bike and Build alumni's house to hang out
for the night.  I got up early this morning, and explored the church and
found a way onto the top of the steeple! The view is unreal of the city
and the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lots of pictures of everything, but I'm not going to have time to
insert them before our fundraiser today, they'll be up in not too long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited for the fundraiser today, we're going to be riding the new
bike share cruiser bikes, Denver is launching the biggest bike share in
the nation, and then we're getting dinner at a Brewery and I'm going to
check out the flagship REI and see the sunset from the steeple of the
church hopefully!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the riding was a little less exciting, but despite the lack of
scenery and scorching heat it was another great day! The temperature
reached 106F, and I rode pretty fast all day to try to beat the heat
into town.  I finished the day with 71 miles of riding, watched the
world cup game, showered and bought an outfit at the thrift store, ate,
talked to Lauren, and bowled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on I started with the “Hold Me Love Me” chore group, and Mark, but
that group didn’t stay together for very long.  I ended up riding more
quickly with Mark and Noah, and after a little while Tio and Mark and I
took off.  Lunch was nice at about 36 miles, and I ate quick to head out
with the first group.  Joe, Tio, Sarah G, Mark and I were the first out,
but in a mile or so it was just Mark and I.  We were facing a pretty
stiff headwind all day, but Mark and I set a nice even pace that we held
for the next 35 miles straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed through two towns during the ride, distinguished from the
landscape with towering grain elevators.  This northwestern part of
Kansas has actually been the flattest."&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Oberlin, KS</title><link href="/2010/06/25/oberlin-ks/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-25T16:49:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-25T16:49:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-25:/2010/06/25/oberlin-ks/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was a nice, very hot, 70 mile ride into Oberlin.  We enjoyed nice

got a cone of ice cream during lunch at DQ, and got a root beer float at
A&amp;amp;W in Oberlin, they're \$.99 on Friday! Riding with Aileen for the
first time was really nice, getting to knoew her better was nice.  We
were the first ones into lunch, and I took a nap haha so I was like the
last to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the miles go by after lunch we shared stories about how we got
to know our gf/bfs and that was fun hearing from people.  There wasn't
too much to see for scenery on the ride today, the beauty of the
flatness and farm fields is waning haha.  Showers were great (a perfect
cool temperature) and I'm about to take a nap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I got too many pics today but here's what I got haha:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;And into Phillipsburg today!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I got a little late start, per usual but a group of 6 of us
cruised pretty good.  I pulled from the host for about 8 miles, as we
passed just about everyone else.  When I went to pull off, I looked
behind me and the WHOLE TEAM had jumped on, I was pulling all like 25!!
That was fun haha, and we didn't see below 20mph with the tailwind, all
the way to... (at mile 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I went to the post office to mail Lindz a post card and
piece of twine for her birthday, and ended up sticking the postcard and
twine in an envelope...didn't want to trust that the tape would hold it
on a postcard.  The postlady there was super nice, and I talked to her
for awhile about what we were doing, and she made a \$10 donation to the
group!!  Thank you so much!  Again the generosity and goodness of people
that we have met from east to west is enough to restore anyone's faith
in humanity.  This country is just filled with awesome people, and
that's easy to forget watching the evening news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was behind pretty much everyone, just sweeps and Jesse and Alyson were
at lunch when I passed back by.  So I found some big gear and crushed
until I caught the rest.  They were all pretty bunched up, in little
groups spread over a quarter mile, so I just kept on cruisin through.
 When I got near the front of the groups, we hit a pretty decent little
hill and Zach was riding away from them a little bit.  So I got my
sprint on, and yelled to him that there was "No way you're getting the
KOM jersey that easy!" and passed him to the top haha.  We were by
ourselves, and riding at a better tempo felt good so we rode fast for
awhile.  I really enjoy riding with Zach, it's fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 15 miles or so, sure enough Jesse had caught us...which must've
been some chase because we were cruisin.  The country roads were still
beautiful and we didn't see more than 1 car every 3 miles.  After some
time of going real fast, and Zach telling Jesse and I how he was an old
man haha, I spotted what could possibly be two riders ahead of us.
 Impossible...Noah was on sweep and I remember passing Derrick...but I
remembered that Heather and Jen had left lunch real early.  When we got
close, Zach told Jesse and I to "go get 'em" like we were dogs or
something haha, and I told Zach to come up beside us and we would see
who could hold 25mph the longest (by which point I'd hoped we'd have
caught them).  After a minute of pushing real hard, Zach dropped back a
little and eventually Jesse faded as well, and I decided that there was
no reason to hurt haha so I slowed down.  Jesse caught right up and then
we were with Heather.  I was gasping for air by the time we caught her,
and she seemed suprised haha.  I headed up to tell Jen how fast she
must've been going because they were so hard to catch haha.  After
another while I guess, Jesse and Zach and Jen and I took off pretty fast
again.  We kinda left Heather hangin but I guess Jen figured she could
handle it haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only about 10 miles to go, we saw a couple riders pushing their
heavily loaded bikes up a hill. We all stopped, but Zach kept going and
Jen left shortly.  Jesse and I talked to the man and woman for a little,
and turns out that he had a flat tire.  They were biking to the east
coast, without too much plan it seemed and both of them with their
guitars.  We offered a patch kit or one of our tubes but they wouldn't
fit, so we wished eachother luck and headed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen was real hard to catch by that point, and after 5 miles we finally
got her haha.  Then Jesse took off to catch Zach, because Jen said that
he wanted to get there first haha ahead of me and Jesse, but I didn't
really feel like working haha.  I rode out the last 5 or so with Jen and
turns out that Jesse got him just one stoplight before the church.  Zach
wasn't really trying to stay in front, but it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Methodist Church of Phillipsburg directed us to a pool and
showers, which were awesome after we unloaded the whole trailer.  I
tried to dive pretty unsuccessfully haha but it sounded entertaining.
 Showers were nice and we went to the Chubby Pickle restaurant, famous
for their Super Chubby hamburger, which I got loaded with homemade
chili.  Swimming, good food, showers, wifi, a couch to sleep on and I
was a very happy man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a great dinner, talking to members of the church was nice,
a chiropractor stopped by and then had a town hall meeting with the
group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In about 5 hours I'll be gettin up so it's time for bed for me though!
Thanks for reading, more to come as we approach the Rocky Mountains
heading into Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Clay Center, KS</title><link href="/2010/06/22/clay-center-ks/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-22T17:54:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-22T17:54:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-22:/2010/06/22/clay-center-ks/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was super short, at 40 miles, and we got to sleep in until 6!

fact, the ride was so flat and short that it really felt like another
day off haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning I was going to try to swap out my chain, which I thought
was going to be real easy but turned out that I could not break my
master link.  It's a link in the chain that should come apart so that I
can take it off.  I was hoping to re-use that master link on the new
chain, since I didn't know where the Shinamo break-off pin went.  After
20 minutes of trying and no luck...I gave up on changing the chain.  I
really wanted to get it done though, because chains wear more quickly
than the other gears, and can wear those gears if you run a stretched
chain on them.  If you change your chain on time (before it gets too
bad), it is possible to get three chains on one cassette.  Meaning, I
only have to replace the back gears (\$70) every three times I replace
the chain.  But, my chain is way past gone (very stretched) so every
mile is just wearing away my cassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered the guy from the bike shop in town last night telling me
that he would be in early in the morning to do a fit, and if any of us
needed anything to give him a call.  But his card, with his number, was
packed away in my bin in the trailer at that point.  Since it was on the
way out (if I made it) I went through town to see if he was there and I
could get my chain changed out, and if I needed, a new cassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got there at 8am, I saw that they weren't open till 10 and was a
little bummed.  But I saw him inside and he came and unlocked the door,
and I told him that I wanted to see if he could help me change the
chain, and get a new cassette if I needed.  He was glad to help, like he
said, and let me in.  There was another mechanic there, and a guy
getting fitted on a bike, and we put my bike in a stand went to taking
the old chain off.  He couldn't get the master link either, and just
broke the chain somewhere else to try removing the master link off the
bike.  After a little bit, he let the other mechanic try it, and after
another little while of messing with it, he realized that it was one of
the black SRAM non-breakable master links!! It was a one-use one,
actually a power-link! I was cleaning my cassette real nice for the new
chain in the meantime, and since I didn't have the breakable pin, or an
old quick-link, he had a new KMC one, sweet! So we put that on, he
showed me how to size the chain in small-small which was cool.  To test
the cassette we looked at how it shifted, which would suffer if it was
too warn.  Luckily, it shifted like a beaut and so I was good!  For all
the help, I tipped him extra and was on my way.  I reset the odometer to
track the new chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour had passed, but I wasn't worried at all and just cruised along
at an easy pace.  The new chain was awesome, it was super quiet and just
felt smooth.  After 20 miles of beautiful rolling KS hills, I arrived at
lunch and had caught up with sweeps.  After explaining why I was behind
them, Emily and Dave and I set out to finish the ride.  We had a
noticeable tailwind which was sweet, and really nice roads.  The ride
was awesome, we caught up with Raleigh when were getting close and it
was starting to get really hot.  Dave sprinted up a few hills and I
stuck with him, he's gettin freakin strong for not having ridden at all
before the trip! Toward the end, we found Jen with a flat and waited
with her to change it, and was we rolled out, my tire was flat! I
figured it was another slow leaker, and after pumping it up, I figured
it would hold that air for the last 3 miles into town, and it did.  I
really do need to get the new tires on there I think.  I'm going to try
to patch some of my tubes tonight hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got to the host, the AC was wonderful but I forgot my shorts to
go to the showers, and luckily Noah let me borrow a pair.  We played
some knock out at the high school there, and after getting back to our
host at the First Baptist Church here in Clay Center I've taken a nap,
munched on food, practiced on the guitar, worked on the affordable
housing curriculum presentation that Will and I will be giving tomorrow,
did the mid-trip leader evals, and typed up the day here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually didn't get my camera out, in was in the rain fly because we
felt some drops.  The country is pretty, but I guess nothing in
particular sparked my attention enough to make me stop haha.  Tomorrow
shouldn't be very long either, something like 57 miles to Beloit!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Lawrence and Manhattan, Kansas!</title><link href="/2010/06/20/lawrence-and-manhattan-kansas/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-20T16:06:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-20T16:06:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-20:/2010/06/20/lawrence-and-manhattan-kansas/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we biked into Lawrence, college home of Christina at KU!

&lt;p&gt;And then after lunch, it looked like rain for sure.  We were on some
really nice country roads, out in the middle of nowhere...and they
turned gravel.  I wasn't a happy camper about that, but we made it over
the gravel without flats so it was all good! We stopped to fill up our
tires with air, and were dripping sweat with the heat and humidity after
working hard across gravel.  But then, the most insane temperature
change that I have ever felt took place, and it was windy and pretty
cold immediately! The sweat and coldness made me a little cold, and it
was definitely going to rain now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came to a closed road, and apparently some motorcyclists had come
back and told other people that there was a bridge down.  I rode through
the barriers yelling "Never surrender!" haha and really wanted to go
check it out for myself (it was only a mile away and I'm almost certain
we could have passed it on bikes) but the leaders told me I had to take
the detour, lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were going around the bridge, the skys opened with a rain so cold
and hard that people thought it had hailed because it hurt so bad.  I
was yelling "OW!" and a few other things as we tried to push through it,
Jesse Mark and I at the front now.  After a little bit, the water was
getting in my eyes and stinging so bad I couldn't really open them so I
reached into my bag and put on my swim goggles lol.  I couldn't see
hardly anything with those either, but could see the white line on the
side of the road and hugged that.  At a stop sign, a guy in a pick-up
asked me if I wanted a ride, that we must be crazy, but I'm still
determined to ride every inch although it was a tempting offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the rain let up, Mark must've been feeling great because he
had ridden away fast and it was just Jesse and I.  We saw someone coming
up to us, and we were by no means going slow, and Zach had caught us! He
complained a little bit about how hard we were to catch (kidding) and I
was really impressed, it must've been some effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we came back for dinner, another swim to cool off, and I passed out
on a couch hard haha.  I barely even woke up for the security alarm that
went off in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Today's ride&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today started out again at 5AM, although I was so warm and comfy on that
couch I bummed it till 5:30 haha.  They had Honey Bunches O' Oats which
are quickly becoming my favorite cereal, and we actually got around to
leaving by 6:30! I was on clean up crew, and didn't get out till a few
minutes later after sweeping the floor though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out at a relaxed pace, me on the front of a group at about
17MPH just keepin my pedals moving haha.  We saw some awesomely cool
clouds, some that looked like glaciers beyond mountains.  I got some
pictures when we stopped to prepare for rain (cover the camera, and
others put on rain jackets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch 1 at mile 35 (we had two because the heat index was at 104) was
good, and we went pretty hard between lunch 1 and 2.  Zach caught up to
us and pulled for 10 miles, Mark pulled for 10, and I pulled hard for
another 10.  It ended up just being us three by that time, although
Emily and Kristen weren't far behind at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At lunch a whole bunch of people caught up, and we took off with a big
group to try a big paceline haha.  We were doing one mile pulls, and our
goal was 17mph but with a strong tailwind, we were soon goin 23! Then
not too far along, about 8 miles from the host, Zach got a flat.  Him
and I tried to patch it, and after doing all that it was leaking, and we
found another hole... So we checked it out again and put another tube in
it.  It had been like 20 minutes, so we told the rest of the group to
head on.  After about 30 we were back on the road, and basically just
cruised into town, movin easily at 23 with that tailwind on the flats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our wonderful hosts at the First Methodist Church tonight had all sorts
of goodies, an entire kitchen worth, set out for us to eat when we got
here! They had gatorade and soda and water on ice and made us lasagna
for dinner, it was awesome! Showers were over at the First Presbytarian,
and there was only one so it was a wait but no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a chance to call my Dad on this father's day which was nice to
chat, and talked to Mom for a little too, and sounds like they're doing
well! I'm super glad for their support on this trip, it has been
awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, I'm going to try to get some pictures in the last
post, and check out the video that I'm going to put up of our build day.

breakfast which was good, I had two things of oatmeal and bagel, and was
packed in time to get my bin out before they started loading the
trailer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;video: &lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/final.avi"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;
(i'm working on embedding it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The ride&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting our cue sheets, on which there were a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of turns, we
found out that it's only a 90 mile day! (the website had said 106) That
still means we get two lunches though :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an absolutely beautiful day to ride today, and we had nice roads!
At mile 10, we stopped to stretch and I'm pretty sure that by the end of
the trip I'll be able to put my whole hand down in front of my toes
&lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;shoes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miles flew by, and I'm pretty certain it was because we had a decent
tailwind the whole way.  The terrain was rolling, with some pretty
decently sized inclines and declines.  On one of the downhills I hit
46.3MPH still pedaling, in Lance's book I read he said that they break
70 down the Alps...that's craziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mile 30 I was starving, since I hadn't eaten since breakfast and was
banking on this lunch stop.  As we passed a gas station at mile 30 and
one at mile 31 where he could've pulled over I was thinking
"Derrick....you're killing me!" But as we climbed to the top of a hill
at mile 32, lunch! It was at a super nice little park, with SHADE: worth
the two mile wait haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed out with the faster group of Noah and Sharif and Emily and Emma
and Mark, among others, and we set a good pace for the next 30 miles.
 Again the miles seemed to fly by, and possibly the funniest part of the
day was when this biker dude passed us on a chopper bike (handlebars
higher than his head) going into town, Mark and Noah and I tried to look
as cool by putting our hands up and turning them to go faster.  Then he
must've stopped somewhere in town, because he passed us again and when
he did, all 3 of us immediately put our hands up just like him haha, all
in sync.  It was pretty great, I'm sure it was one of those "you had to
be there" things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with Joe and Aileen and Tio who had left lunch before us,
and as soon as we did Joe turned around because his camelbak nozzle had
come off.  Noah pulled at a moderately fast pace for like 6 miles, and
then when Joe caught back on he asked me if I wanted to crank it.  I
thought he meant go up and give Noah a break, so I grabbed his wheel.
 But we hit the front and then just kept on cruisin.  Turns out Joe's
speedometer wasn't working so he didn't know how fast he was going, and
just felt like hammering.  For a good two miles he pulled so hard that I
could barely stick, at like 23 up the hills and 28 down them.  After
that I pulled and barely increasing my effort, I was going all out.
 Sitting in the aerobars, our speed picked up to close to 30 across the
flats and after about two more miles I looked back and realized that I
had just gapped Joe a little. That was the hardest I have ridden yet on
BnB and it felt great.  We happened to be at mile 64, so we waited for
the other riders and van to catch up for lunch #2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My awesome habit of not wanting to hop right back on the bike after
eating and cooling down kicked in, and I tried to nap in the sliver of
shade next to the building whose empty lot we were in.  It was heating
up for sure, and I was trying hard not to get back in the sun.  I did
lay my jersey out on the pavement though so it would dry haha.  After an
hour and half of eating and with two unsuccessful attempts at a nap (my
phone had turned itself off by this point) I wanted to get going again.
 Pretty much everybody had come and gone, so I headed out with Jesse and
Alyson who were taking it easy(er) for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got riding and got some wind, the heat didn't melt us lol and
again with the slight tailwind, we made great progress toward our host.
 We got in to Raytown, MO and our wonderful hosts at the Blue
Ridge Presbyterian Church and I was at mile 93...so I rode around the
streets crit style and got in 100 miles! Ended up with 103 on the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Building!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat was intense, I don't know how hot it got exactly but with
humidity I was melting haha.  We rebuilt a porch for a lady who has
owned her Habitat home for 31 years, it was the first one that Kansas
City's affiliate had built, and they're the 8th oldest in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Kansas City</title><link href="/2010/06/18/kansas-city/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-18T23:19:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-18T23:19:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-18:/2010/06/18/kansas-city/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey avid readers!

stayed in.  So much has happened that I think it would be next to
impossible for me to write it all but some highlights were: jumping off
a (10ft) bridge during the ride to Jeff City was fun, the ride to Jeff
City was good all around (minus the flats), and Mark and I got to see
Jure Rovic ride by who is leading the Race Across America! That was all
yesterday and today's ride wasn't as enjoyable with rain and busier
roads, and a spill, but we're all doing great and tonight, we
had chiropractors and a massage therapist!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_972" align="aligncenter" width="200"
caption="Holy bug bites!! Joe got it the
worst"]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mosquitos.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mosquitos-200x300.jpg" title="mosquitos"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way to Jefferson City, we were on the Katy Trail, a packed cinder
bikeway, for 80 some miles (the whole way).  The night before I had
looked up online where and when the RAAM, Race Across America, would be
coming through Jeff City and from what I could tell, it was at 2PM only
one block from where we were staying! So Jesse and I were &lt;em&gt;pumped&lt;/em&gt; to
see and potentially ride with some RAAM guys and we took off as early
was we could in the morning and hit it real hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hadn't had any problems the day before from the trail, but just a
little over an hour and 20 miles in, I got a flat.  As soon as we rolled
to a stop, we were covered in mosquitoes though.  So Jesse and I
literally ran with my rear wheel as we took the tire off, put a new tube
in and put the tire back on.  It must have looked totally ridiculous to
the guys biking by but when we yelled mosquitoes they understood haha.
 To pump the tire while running, I held the tire, and put the pump
against my chest, and Jesse had to pump it against my chest.  There was
definitely no time for pictures, but at lunch you can see what they had
done to Joe who had to change a flat as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not more than 10 miles later, I had another flat.  We had tried to get
out fast to get there, and were prepared with enough clif bars to go
straight through...but these flats were killing us.  The first one had
taken 20 minutes to change while running, and there weren't as many
mosquitoes near this one but still it was very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the decision to take the highway, Highway 94, that ran parallel
to the trail and right into our destination, because we were only a
small way there and had already used two of our three tubes! The highway
was not busy at all, it was only a two lane, and was about the same
speed as the trail because while the gravel on the trail provided
rolling resistance, there was an equal headwind on the unsheltered road.
 As soon as our tires hit the paved road, it was unbelievably smooth
haha and we made it the rest of the day without flats.&lt;/p&gt;

approached Jefferson City, it was spectacular to see the skyline in the

&lt;p&gt;When we got into town, Jesse and I knew we were well ahead of everyone
else so we headed right for the RAAM timecheck.  We happened to be early
though, and saw a bike shop on the way that had potential.  It was a
pretty cool shop, and I picked up a patch kit haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rode out Jefferson St looking for the timecheck, our host church at
the First Presbytarian was only one street over.  We rode out there for
a mile, and over some sizeable hills (really steep, their hills aren't
huge but they build roads straight up them haha).  Problem was, after
about 10 miles and 45 minutes of searching allllll over the place, we
couldn't find anything at all that could have been the timecheck.  So we
headed back to the church, and caught up with some others to check out
the capitol building that we had been riding toward for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all starving from our long day, and got some really good pizza
downtown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_977" align="aligncenter" width="200"

pizza"]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pizza.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pizza-200x300.jpg" title="pizza"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out there again to look for the timecheck with the others that
had came, but still nothing.  The bike shop hadn't heard about it, which
was lame, but they let us use their computer to check the location.
 Sure enough, we were right both times but there was just nothing there
yet....they should have been set up at 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back to the church and showered and had a great dinner, all
awesome as always.   I think I'm running out of adjectives to describe
the generosity that we have been shown by our hosts, and how we have
eaten like kings.  We gave a presentation, and Britt told her story of
involvement in the affordable housing cause, which had to have given
everyone in the room chills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, Alyson Jesse Mark and I headed back out there again to
find the timecheck, but at the place it should have been still found
nothing! We looked on Alyson's blackberry, and she had the idea of
checking the personal blog of the leader rather than relying on the RAAM
website.  Sure enough, the leader Jure Rovic had a website
(&lt;a href="http://jurerobic.net/cms/"&gt;http://jurerobic.net&lt;/a&gt;) with a GPS tracker
but it didn't load on the phone so we called someone back at the church
to look at it on my computer.  She looked and determined that he wasn't
super close...at least 50 miles out (so a few hours) so we headed back
the very hilly mile to the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using his website, and the RAAM site, Mark and I determined that he
would be in Jeff City at about 1:30AM.  We had put so much time and
energy into seeing this guy that we weren't going to let the Bike and
Build curfew stop us from walking the block over to see him ride by, so
Mark and I woke up at 1 and went over there to see.  After about 20
minutes, he should have been there because the GPS had shown him at the
timecheck, only a mile away.  But we hadn't seen a single thing all day,
and decided to bike baaack out there to see.  It was night, but we
didn't see a car the whole time we were out there and Mark's lights were
real bright.  Back out we went, and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an RV and a minivan in the gas station parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jure was inside the RV sleeping for an hour, we got talking to his
mechanic and his strategy was to not sleep for the first 48 hours, then
sleep one hour every night.  He showed us the equipment, and told us all
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_981" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;So all in all, he had 8 people in the two vehicles supporting him.  A
full time cook, doctor, two mechanics, and drivers who needed to be
equally as sleep-intolerant as Jure had trained to be to drive the van
all day 10 feet behind him.  On the bike, he carries only one water
bottle, and that's it! No computer, no food, nothing on his back.
 Anything he needed the hand to him from the van.  They get directions
to him via loudspeaker from the van behind him, and it's actually RAAM
required that it be right behind him at night all the time, equipped
with mega headlights and flashers.  After chatting for awhile, we headed
back to the church to see him come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_983" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;We cheered him on, at 3AM on the desolate downtown street, and as he
stopped at the light and we were chanting "Keep it up" we got a mumbled
"Alright" it sounded like haha.  So we actually got to see the leader of
the Race Across America, heading for his 5th win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;To Sedalia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we headed out for shorter day, 61 miles, to be spent on Rt 50.  It
started out slow, I was sore from the hard ride the day before and from
my 2ish hours of sleep haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was riding behind Britt when she took a spill on the road, the road
surface was about 2 inches higher than the shoulder, and created a curb
that is a disaster for road bikes.  She hit her hip pretty hard, but
she's going to be fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole group had stopped, and after we got started again, at about
mile 20 we spotted a Sonic. Remembering that I had a handful of free
coupons in my hand, between Derrick and I we had enough to get our whole
riding group free Cherry Limeades! They were good, a little too
carbonated and sweet for Emily but on a positive note Jen rode into
Sonic without going face first on the sidewalk this time haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_985" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was pretty uneventful, as was most of the day.  At some point, it
started raining real hard and cold and windy, so I made sure that our
last rider had a strong tail light because from the front I couldn't see
a thing on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hosts at the First Baptist Church in Sedalia are awesome, and
provided us with not only an excellent dinner, but with &lt;em&gt;a massage
therapist and two chiropracters!!&lt;/em&gt; I felt like a pro, getting my
post-race massage haha.  It was great, and I wish I could get an
adjustment every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is going to be a long day into Kansas City, where we will build
for two days, and I'm headed to be at 10PM for our 5AM wake up!!&lt;/p&gt;

able to spend almost the whole day on a bike trail that was packed
cinder (totally rideable!). I was expecting loose gravel from rumors the
night before, but it was fine. I did, however, manage to take a wrong
turn and to bike by lunch, adding a total of 16 miles to our 55 mile
day! Our host at St. Peter's United Church here in Washington had
showers on site (always a plus) and provided us with an excellent dinner
tonight. We went and checked out the town which is cool, right on the
Missouri River, and are going to bed early for a very long day tomorrow
(96 miles!?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The ride...how did I get lost?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try to remember just how this happened haha, but it was
just strange.  During the ride, I wasn't having too much fun riding
really hard by myself and not being able to utilize the path to actually
ride side by side, or check out the attractions but it all worked out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we rode on some bigger roads for the first 13 miles or so, and going
down to the river to get on the trail, the path led to the left, but you
could both ways.  I had went down it by myself, and Sarah W was behind
me so I shouted back "left turn, right?!" but she heard "left turn!" so
she said "yeah!" so I had thought that she looked at cue sheet and it
said left.  I haven't had my cue sheet out yet, maybe I should work on
that... I rode pretty fast to catch people, a little over 20mph across
the gravel, but started to get worried after 3 miles and not seeing
anyone at all.  So I stopped a couple, and they told me I was at the end
of the trail! We were supposed to be on that trail for 35 miles, so I
turned it around and caught Sarah on my way back and we headed back.  It
was only a 6 mile detour, and the road was really nice so I didn't mind
it.  The only problem was that the 20 minutes of riding had put us
behind everyone.  I rode hard to try to catch someone, and passed the
sweep riders after a few miles back in the right direction and kept on
going.  I was riding really hard, at about 19mph solid on the flat
cinder into a headwind.  But I just never caught up to anyone! After 42
miles of hard riding in the heat I was out of water (drank both 20oz
bottles of gatorade and the 100oz camelbak) and ate both my clifbars and
I was starving from riding so hard with still a lot of miles to go, so I
called our van driver, and he said that lunch was at mile 30!  Which
meant that with my previous detour, I was only about 5 miles from
lunch...so around I turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch wasn't shaded at all, so I &lt;em&gt;poured&lt;/em&gt; on some PB and jelly to two
pieces of bread (doubled up haha) and it was just sooo hot and I'd been
riding hard by myself for so long that I was kinda miserable.  The only
people left at lunch by the time I got back there were sweep, so I
stuffed down some old pasta and headed out to try to catch up to another
group.  My legs were pretty tired by that point and after eating my body
didn't want to push...but eventually I actually caught up to some
people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got to relax with everyone, I was sad that I had missed going to
the winery or micro-brewery along the way (just to check it out, no one
can drink since we're riding).  It was really nice, and my day turned
onto a positive note for sure.  We talked about how so much confusion
could have happened haha, the group I had caught up to had missed lunch
entirely, and I'd ridden 17 miles furthur than them haha...it was just
all mixed up because no one knew where anyone else was on the trail
(couldn't chalk the gravel) and it was just strange how we got so messed
up on a straight trail haha.&lt;/p&gt;

got close to 70 miles on the day, the first half into lunch was country
roads and then as we approached the city it got busier.  Highlights
included: seeing the arch, crossing into another state, and getting new
sandals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we built with Rebuilding Together of St. Louis, and it was great
to be able to help out multiple people by improving the conditions that
they live in.  Then we got to swim, play basketball, and play table
tennis! And I got to talk to Lauren for a while which was good, hope she
has fun on her road trip tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the early part of the ride out of Greenville on route 140,
which wasn't bad.  It was more cornfields, and there were parts where we
could ride close enough to talk which makes the riding go by.  At 10 and
20 miles both we stopped to stretch which was nice, and I pulled lightly
into a headwind for the majority of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long after our second stretch break, my ankle hit my crank again
on the right, and it hurt really bad.  It felt weird clipping it out,
and sure enough the clip had actually slipped.  So Jesse stopped with me
and we moved and re-tightened it and caught up to the others before
getting to lunch, which was behind a McDonalds today haha.  The bad part
about that was that there was no place for shade to escape the heat or
to nap, but we really didn't have time for nap today anyway haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into the city was sketchy for a lot of people, but I didn't mind
the riding at all! It was kinda exciting, and our stay host here in the
gym of UMSL is nice.  We've got table tennis, a pool, the basketball
arena, showers and laundry...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner for both nights was absolutely amazing, I'm really running out of
words to describe how awesome the trip and the people and food along the
way have been.  Christina and Sarah G's parents provided the dinners,
and we got to experience some real St. Louis cookin.  Pork steaks the
first night were bomb and tonight the spinach salad and just everything
was spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working today was great, I got to fix up walls and install flooring in
the bathroom of a house with Jesse, and it was so hot up there that we
couldn't find a dry spot &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; on our clothes haha.  Not the heat
really though, it was the humidity.  Coming back to swim and shower and
play basketball and table tennis was great.  I'm ready for the next four
days, including a 95 and 106 mile day on our way to Kansas City where we
build for two days.  For pictures, I'm working on using flickr and here
is the URL for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51163058@N08/sets/72157624262049394/"&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51163058@N08/sets/72157624262049394/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't really do captions but in reverse order they show the Ohio
River, the Arch and the view from that at night (and the ride up it),
cool things from downtown that night and today they show some of the
roof we put up under a porch.  Check out that board that I cut to fit in
the angled space...it fit so tight that it held itself up, boom! And
there is a picture of the neighborhood that we were doing the work in,
it was rough but I'm glad to be helping where it's really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumor is that they next two day, and 160 miles are on gravel...so not
looking forward to that part, but at least now I'm expecting gravel
trail so when I find pavement I'll be even happier! Better than the
opposite haha, that's what I was just telling Jen.  Alyson, one of our
fearless leaders, just confirmed the rumor, sorta haha so it should be
interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on getting a better photo system still, leave comments about
how this flickr thing works! Here are the very best haha:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch I got an epicly awesome nap in, using the helmet pillow! I'll
demonstrate the helmet pillow later sometime haha.  After that nap, a
bunch of us cruised at like 22mph with a slight tailwind after after an
hour of pulling, we caught up with Raleigh, Laura and Heather and they
were determined to find a pool.  We found one, they let us in for free,
and it felt great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't have internet at our host, although I bought an ethernet cable
in hopes that the wall port would work haha. So apologies that this is
going up late I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I didn't really get a chance to finish the blog either, but
came back and started reading the book that I had brought with me on the
trip: "It's Not About the Bike" by Lance Armstrong. Tonight, I finished
it! That's how I read books, because I really enjoy reading and so once
I get started I don't want to put it down. Also helps that I had four
hours today to lay under a tree when it was beautiful out and read,
which was real nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's riding was good, it was windy but it really wasn't that bad at
all. For the first time, we could see the flatness of the land extending
through farms for miles. Some of the silos and elevators made tractor
trailers look small haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to ride hard in the aerobars, and after lunch I had waited too
long and ended up riding by myself for the first time without quickly
catching someone or being caught. It really wasn't that fun at all, the
plains were nothing to look at all, and I had a hard time keeping my
eyes open really haha. So, I decided to do some intervals to keep myself
interested, and in doing a 1 on, 1 off, 2 on, 2 off, 3 on, 2 off, 2 on,
1 off, 1 on pyramid at 23mph into the headwind, I actually caught up
with some friends :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were only like 15 miles left then, and I tried to set a pace at
which I could pull them without making them work too hard, and we
cruised all the way into town at 15-16mph, and attempted to talk through
the wind riding single file, but mostly unsuccessfully trying to talk
haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hosts a Sacred Heart (our first Catholic host church) were totally
awesome and had more snacks than I knew what to do with, and drinks
already laid out for us! It was sweet. I hopped back on the bike before
changing and went to the post office, taking Kristen's thing to mail
too. I whipped through town which is a lot of fun really, cruisin
through the turns and timing the lights and drafting and such, I was
feeling good. Got to talking to the post office mail guy, and turns out
that he was into cycling and we talked about our trip and he was telling
me all about RAAM which has a checkpoint in Effingham! It was really
cool, and when it came time to pay, he said he's got it. I asked him if
he was sure, and he was, and I'm continuely amazed by the generosity of
the people we meet and the hosts who feed and house us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back I stopped by a computer store I saw on the way there,
and picked up an ethernet cable with the hope that the port would work,
and that I could probably use it later on the trip but no beans. When I
got back to the church, most had gone to shower and they were running a
last shuttle but didn't have room for one of us. I grabbed my shower
stuff and hopped back on the bike and beat them there and back haha, and
even got a little lost and got a tour of the HS here haha. Showers were
cold, but I was hot from riding around town and riding there, so it
actually felt good once I overcame the shock of the cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight we had an excellent dinner, and gave a presentation to our host,
hung out (threw some disc and footballs) with the youth group here and
then did our affordable housing presentations, which were good. I typed
this guy up on notepad and hopefully it'll be going up early tomorrow! I
would hope to stop in a coffee shop on the way or something, but can't
really carry the laptop with me haha. Oh, I got an idea...put it on a
flash drive...and maybe find a library! Anyway that's all for tonight,
I'm hoping to talk to Lauren soon and then hit the hay.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Terre Haute, Indiana</title><link href="/2010/06/08/terre-haute-indiana/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-08T21:45:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-08T21:45:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-08:/2010/06/08/terre-haute-indiana/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we tallied over 1,000 miles on our journey across the country thus

far! The 60 mile ride to Terre Haute, out of Bloomington, was awesome
and flew right by.  We put in all 60 miles, lunch included, before noon!
The countryside noticeably flattened he further we went, and I could
start to see the cornfields extend for maybe half a mile, almost to the
plains for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning started out with a little scare, when I went to retrieve my
bibs and jersey that I had hung up on some hangers I found to discover
that the room they were in had been locked! After a few phone calls
though, we had someone at the church to let me in there by 6:30 (an hour
after I woke up) and so it was all good.  For breakfast I had 6 bowls of
cheerios because we were trying to make space in the coolers and of
course I had to help out as much as I could lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10 miles in we stopped to take a stretch break, and I got in an
excellent stretch, one of the best I've had haha.  I can almost lay my
hands flat in front of my toes! At lunch, I had a delicious lunch too
and yeah the rest of the ride was smooth sailin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's almost 11 and so we have to be back to the church, so I'll
finish tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>To Bloomington, Indiana!</title><link href="/2010/06/07/to-bloomington-indiana/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-07T23:02:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-07T23:02:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-07:/2010/06/07/to-bloomington-indiana/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we got to sleep in until 6:30 which was great...and I was on the

Bloomington (home of Indiana University) is really really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out slow, and I pulled into the wind for awhile which was
good because I can pedal hard and get to help out other people! There
were still some inclines along the way, but no real big ones and we made
great time. About halfway on our ride we got to Nashville, and we
stopped at a super cool coffee shop and got some fudge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nashville was such a super cool town, soo many little shops it would be

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was about 30 miles in, at the top of a small hill that Dave and I
sprinted up being chased by a dog haha.  I got to eat the leftover
enchiladas from the night before which were &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, I realllly wanted to go find the&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_500"&gt;Little
500&lt;/a&gt;track so I headed out on my
bike to explore because that's always fun.  Bloomington is one of the
nicest college towns we've been in, I enjoyed it a lot, and the campus
was gorgeous as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_780" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;I ran into a teacher at the university, and asked how to get to the
track and ended up talking to her about cycling, (she was on a bike and
commutes on one) and what I am doing and it was cool.  I had to ask
another guy before I found it haha.  I was amazed by the castle-sized
frats here, they are rediculous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I came back and we walked over the brewery for free beer (free

&lt;p&gt;And that was the day!! A really long day for such a short ride, but

Right after we left the skies opened and there was a massive downpour,
we all got soaked (at least I did) and it was raining so hard we could
barely see.  But biking in the rain is fun and it cleans the bikes, and
then we all overcame the headwind for 87 miles to make it to Columbus!
One group managed to find an exotic animal farm along the way too haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually didn't take a single picture during the day, FAIL...my camera
was in it's waterproof bag and frankly, nothing sparked my interest
enough to take a picture of haha.  I got one picture on the day of
Kristen, Caroline, and Jen sleeping together on the couch, but I'm using
Jen's laptop so I'll save that one for tomorrow, it's good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About the riding, lots of corn and wheat:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there wasn't actually a state sign when we crossed the border.
 There was a street that was on the border we rode on, so it was fun to
cross the line like 30 times haha weaving across the double yellow.  The
whole day was relatively flat, although we were going slightly up or
downhill pretty much the whole ride.  What made it difficult was the
massive headwind that we had to go straight into, that kinda headwind
that makes you wish we were biking from West to East haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch and when the headwind started to pick up, I was riding a
little ahead of our group so Sarah W came up and joined me.  After
pulling for awhile, I was going to wait for the group so I sat behind
Sarah and then Sharif came up and asked if we minded if he pulled lol.
 So he went a little harder, and we ended up losing the group pretty
hard and eventually it was just us two, so I thought we should stop and
wait so we pulled over on a nice lawn and took a nap! It was a nice nap,
the sun came out for a little while, but the group we had waited for
just kept on going by us! So we finished our nap, and with about 30
miles left went to go catch them.  We rode reallly fast for awhile,
pulling at 23mph into the strong headwind, and we never saw them...
Aileen had a water stop like 12 miles from the finish and when we got
there she said that she had passed those guys, but we were the first
ones to the stop.  Strange, we waited there for like half an hour and
finally we found out that they had a busted tire and had waited in a
barn where nobody saw them lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of us decided to finish up the day, and I was still feeling
really good so I pulled pretty hard into Columbus, and Emma, Caroline,
and I were the first ones here! The First Presbytarian church here had
put us up for three years in the past, and within the hour I was all
showered and clean up and eating ANOTHER delicious dinner of enchiladas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pictures, from Jen!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of us watched a movie for the night, after a long day, and most
people are already in bed!! I got two great naps today haha so I'm good,
and so here a a couple of Jen's pictures of the day:&lt;/p&gt;

serious accident and it was scary for everyone.  Luckily Christina was
fine, and aside from being so sad that we had four hurt riders by lunch,
the roads and riding were great.  My low of the week was feeling so bad
at lunch today that we had some many riders down, and my highs were how
impressively Will handled his crash and just kept on riding like nothing
happened, and just how awesome it was to ascend into the Blue Ridge
mountains and how euphoric that day of riding was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My chore group is on trailer crew this week, and I just stuffed
everything into the bin this morning to make it fit so that I had time
to eat and pack the trailer.  Our first attempt at packing the trailer
was a great success, and everything fit with room to spare! No gatorade
or degreaser spills on the day, and it was our doing J&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start out the day, we rode down to check out the murals in Portsmith,
which we were really awesome, and to hop over the bridge to add another
state to our trip, Kentucky!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got around to leaving the town, we very quickly discovered that
there are indeed hills in Ohio, who knew!? The first was long with a
gentle grade which I love, and effortlessly cruised up.  I was able to
surprise myself when I saw dogs that may come out, and had the water
bottle in hand, with how loudly, deeply, and sternly I yelled “STAY!” to
that dog.  It stopped in it’s track, and I’m pretty sure my voice echoed
off the mountain lol.  Idk where that came from, but it was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few hills were actually suuuper steep, and I had to really
pedal hard to make it up them in my littlest gear! They may have been
the steepest hills yet.  The downhills were nearly as steep, and with
some tight switchbacks that left me gripping tight on the brakes all the
way down.  Jesse managed to set the new BnB record with 52.6MPH down one
of them….crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we were on some more really nice roads that went through
what seemed to be a parkway as well.  There was a really nice lake on
the left, and the water was warm and nice so Jesse and I took a
refreshing dip.  Mark only watched haha, afraid to get his bibs wet. 
But it really wasn’t so bad, I dried out super quick it was so hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up to Will standing on the side of the road, and turns out
that he had went down in one of the descents.  He was totally fine, just
scraped up, and so we got him some alcohol and cleansing wipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_720" align="aligncenter" width="300"
caption="He really took it well, and just kept on biking, he wasn’t

&lt;p&gt;When we got to lunch, that’s when things got a little scary.  Heard that
more people had went down on those technical descents, and someone took
a ambulance to the hospital.  We waited around for awhile to kinda hear
what had happened, and turns out that three people other than Will had
taken spills.  Raleigh went down kinda hard, but without losing much
skin and only a scratch on her face, but had hurt her already sore
back.  Lindsey understeered and went off the road, but she was fine and
still riding.  Christina had taken the worst of it, and was unconscious
for a short bit of time then couldn’t remember anything, so she was
taken to the hospital on account of concussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all of this I was in no mood to just keep on riding (or to take
pictures)….but had to ride eventually, and Jesse and I ended up going
hard pretty much all of the way in.  We dropped Mark, who stopped to
take a 45min nap in a field on the side of the road, and Will just rode
on in.  Jesse and I caught up to some others, who we rode with into
town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hosts tonight at the UMC in Georgetown have put Bike and Build for
every year this trip has been running, eight, and had oreos, delicious
cookies, lemonade, crackers, snacks, moisturizes and shampoos and just
everything all laid out for us, it was sweet.  A nice man gave six of us
a ride to the showers, which were good, and they had real towels for us
to use!  Super nice on their part, and definitely helped brighten the
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I spent some time in the local bike shop which is pretty
sweet, they had nice 29er mountain bikes, all carbon road racing
machines, a huge space with couches, and tons of old converted fixies
and single speeds.  I really liked the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed with Christina’s bike at the shop and we made sure that
everything was OK on it, and brought both hers and mine back later, I
was late for dinner but still got some delicious lasagna and salad! 
There was a United Dairy Farmers gas station across the street, and I
got to sample a little bit of a bunch of people’s ice cream which was
nice J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christina got back, and she was OK which was the great news.  We had a
town hall meeting, I got to put up the pictures from yesterday into that
post, and then talk to Lauren for awhile which was really nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I’ve tried to put the ups and downs of today into words,  and
in the end everyone is alright and we are all reminded that we are
responsible for our own safety out there on the road and how important
that really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to ride into Cincinnati tomorrow, lots of people’s relatives
are going to visit and we get to finish our 8^th^ straight day of
biking, and build the next day!!  Should be a lot of fun, and we’re all
going to be riding safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>To Portsmith, Ohio</title><link href="/2010/06/02/to-portsmith-ohio/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-02T16:25:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-02T16:25:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-02:/2010/06/02/to-portsmith-ohio/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We crossed the border today into Ohio, with a shorter and nice 60 mile

have extra room!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical breakfast setup: bagels, cereal, and bananas in the church's
kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only a one mile ride before we crossed the river into Ohio,
here's a picture of my next to the sign on the bridge and of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10 miles, Mark, Emma, Jen, and I stopped for a quick stretch break,
and before long we were at the back of group, which is closer together
on these less mountainous days which is nice.  We got onto some really
nice country roads, and before long had to stop to take a picture with
some of the haybails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_703" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;We saw a pretty cool suspension bridge along the way, but those didn't
really come out but here is one anyway haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not worth the minute it would take to upload haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one really steep, but not very long hill and at the top there
were some very friendly and cute dogs.  One was a puppy :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_704" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;I tried hard to drink lots of water, and successfully finished my
camelbak (100oz of water) and a bottle of gatorade (20oz) for almost a
gallon before lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_705" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of water bottles, I bought two new ones last night because one
of mine had mold in it (I happened to look at the bottom of it at dinner
the other night, it's opaque, and it was really gross) and the other one
has some grease in the threads of the cap and I've been using it....but
I thought I'd play it safe.  I was telling people that I was going to
keep it with the "what's good for the bike is good for me"
philosophy...but nah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_707" align="aligncenter" width="300"

&lt;p&gt;The last 5 miles of today's ride were the worst part, on a pretty busy
highway, but I went fast through it and Jen kept right up with me, I was
impressed.  After surviving that, most of the group stopped for ice
cream, and I got a chocolate shake...yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got here I got to take a shower rigth away (love that) and then
we found out that Sharif had clippers and all the guys went to town
haha.  Dave buzzed his head down with a one, Joe cut his bread into a
handlebar, Noah trimmed his beard into just the dirt stache, and both
Joe and Noah showed their new inner cyclist by shaving their legs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just buzzing my hair straight off (I had the option of a #1
or #2), I decided to go for the mohawk!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_706" align="aligncenter" width="243"

&lt;p&gt;After all of this took place, it was still only 2:30 and so we decided
to go check out the town and grab a snack to hold us over till dinner at
6PM.  Turns out that Kentucky is only a mile away across the river, but
the really sweet suspension bridge didn't have a sidewalk...bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to a few different shops, and ended up getting some snacks at a
cool Irish Pub.  I went in on some super nachos which was a good
decision for sure! The chili tasted homemade, and it'll hold me over
till dinner for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way back, a few of us stopped at the public library to check it
out and turns out they have internet, score! So I cranked out this post
on their computer, too lazy to go get my own to do pix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, I'm excited for the dinner they're going to have for
us.  I'm not tired at all from the riding today...and got my blog out
already so idk what I'm going to do tonight, maybe read haha?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>West Virginia: Marlinton --&gt; Summersville --&gt; Charleston --&gt; Huntington</title><link href="/2010/06/01/west-virginia-marlinton-summersville-charleston-huntington/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-01T17:34:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-01T17:34:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-01:/2010/06/01/west-virginia-marlinton-summersville-charleston-huntington/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past few days have been awesome, although I haven't had internet

access so I haven't been able to keep up the blog every day, so now I
shall attempt to cover four days!! I'm going to try to remember as much
as I can, and go in chronological order.  A quick summary would be that
we have climbed and descended the Appalachian mountains which has been
both challenging and rewarding, I got to see Jean and we ate more,
excellent food! I'm still waiting on some pictures that are on other
people's cameras too haha, namely at the WV border, the top of Black
Mtn...and idk some others lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Marlinton, WV&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second day out of Charlottesville, after the extremely hilly ride to
Lexington, we crossed into WV and I was on sweep for the day.  Two
riders are sweeping every day, I get to do it four times total, and
sweep's job is to ride behind the last riders to make sure that everyone
makes it in for the day, carrying an extra tire and lots of
encouragement!  This was probably one of the toughest days that we will
have, especially to sweep, since people's legs were dead from the huge
day prior and there were some very unrelenting hills.  But my gearing
caught up with me a lot, and it was hard to keep a good cadence up some
of the grades.  Climbing out of the saddle at 3-5mph slowed my cadence
to 30rpm, equal to a full pedalstroke every two seconds (death slow)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught up to the other riders pretty quickly still after our half
hour break, probably because of the speed we took some of the climbs at,
Kristen was doing awesome.  And there are pictures of us all crossing
the border, but it was raining and we were in a hurry so I left my
camera covered up haha.  I was worried for awhile that we wouldn't make
it into the host by dinner, it started to rain, and there
was supposedly a huge climb left.  When we got to that climb, I went on
up (my knees could no longer take the slow hills at low cadence) and it
was only a mile! So I came back down, helped the others up as much as I
could (gave Heather a push lol) and it started pouring as we made it to
the top but it was 5PM and we only had 12 miles left so it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled into town, and when we took a rest at the town sign, a man
pulled up in his car and got out with a big camera.  He asked if we were
Bike and Build and we told him yes of course, and he wanted to take our
picture for the Marlinton town paper! He took our picture there, and
went ahead of us into town to take our picture as we rode in.  That was
pretty awesome timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got into town, we celebrated for the camera and were excited to
be there....but little did we know that "take a right turn and two-three
miles to &lt;em&gt;Mount View&lt;/em&gt; church" was going to be so far and up a massive
climb...and that last climb was pretty tough after the false finish.
 But we made it there, had awesome showers on site, and they had put
together one of the best meals yet.  The peanut butter fudge was just
awesome, and there was more food than I knew what I could do with.  We
ended up taking a lot with us for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the pastor was a bass player in their church band, and on our
group we have an awesome guitarist (two), a drums players, some great
singers and so we went upstairs to the santuary and jammed with the
whole group for a few hours.  I got up and sang some gospel songs I knew
with everyone, and Will who is our awesome guitarist and singer ended
the night to an excellent rendition of Country Roads, it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summersville, WV&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking to Summersville was another very hilly day, the third very hilly
day in a row and it was beginning to take it's toll on me as well.  My
right knee was occasionally pretty sore when I was pedaling, so I tried
hard to keep my cadence up as much as possible up the hills.  There were
5 sizable climbs, the most incredible was a 5 mile uphill, after another
decent hill and all false uphill leading to it, and it was pretty
brutal.  Up and up we went, to 4,500ft!!  The descent was pretty epic as
well, but it was all up and down hills still.  We were on WV-150 which
was a scenic parkway for most of it, and it was really nice riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Charleston, WV&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking into Charleston felt downhill, and although it was 77 miles
didn't seem to take too long at all!  I beat out the massive downpour by
all of 10 seconds haha, and I felt great after the day of riding.
 Showers were right across the street and I got to take one as soon as I
got there, which was reallly nice to clean right up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jean came down from Parkersburg to meet me there, and it was really
great seeing her there.  She ate dinner with us and got to meet some of
the group, and see us sort of "in-action" which was cool.  My BnB
cronies said she enjoyed talking with her, and that was pretty much it
for the night there.  Sharif did make a bet that I couldn't eat the
three pounds of spaghetti on my plate, and oh did he lose that lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Huntington, WV&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the shortest of this whole segment, at 50 miles, and no
mountains!  We decided to check out the capital building in Charleston
before heading out, but didn't find the downtown.  The capital building
is awesome. I definitely ate too much pasta the night before and was
feeling a bit sluggish on the ride.  Pix of the capitol:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got free, fresh (watched them bake and glaze) Krispy Kreme donuts,
ate three and those slowed me down as well haha.  The riding today
seemed to take forever, probably because of the headwind and I was glad
to be done with the day.  But it started to turn around when we got to
the town, went to a really cool bike shop, and got to take a *free*
cooking lesson in Jamie Oliver's food revolution kitchen!! We stopped
there at 1:30, and they had two spots open at 2! We told them about Bike
and Build (we were still pretty sweaty) and normally they ask for \$10
to cover the food (all top-quality) and the lesson but then the other
people came in for the lesson and they were like "OMG we saw you guys on
TV!!" and we felt famous and they told us we didn't need to pay when we
were leaving! We learned how to make four different dressings (not
hard!), a different potato salad (delicious) and learned how to make a
cucumber salad and actually all got to make one! It was all so good,
although our vegan-edition was a little too tart for my taste haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we ate dinner donated by Jimmy Johns (free food galore...)
which was good, and we went out to check out the town and I called and
talked to Lauren on our &lt;em&gt;9th month&lt;/em&gt;!! After people got ice cream and
books haha and I had talked to Lauren :) we went over to a park which
was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

organize photos and differentiate all that I've done for the past for
days! Haha I hope you enjoyed reading, tomorrow we head to Ohio!  There

was the most beautiful I have EVER done. We started bright and early
with a 5AM wake-up call, but weren't leaving the house until our usual
7:30 because there was a lot of cleaning and packing up to be done,
since we had been there for three days.  We headed out some beautiful,
rolling country roads on over to a mountain, up that mountain and onto
the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hilly and VERY beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway.  We started the
day at 750ft above sea level, undulated and climbed to 2500, kept
climbing to 3300, then back to 2200, up to 3200, back down...and again
and again haha. I was in awe of the scenery all day, loved climbed and
jumping in the river here in Lexington was the most refreshing thing
ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a record number, 54!!, pictures today! Some of the them are a few
days old, and those will be first, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we ate some clif shots in preparation for the big climb,
which I hit hard from the bottom and was by myself at the top off.  Mark
wasn't far behind, and neither were Emma or Zach so we rode back to them
and kept on going.  The climb had been hyped up for the past few days
and people were freaking out a little, but it was probably comparable to
Harding, just maybe a little steeper.  The down side of going on up so
quick was that I missed the Cookie Lady though...dissappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best moment of the trip was reaching that very first scenic
overlook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got off the parkway on US-60, taking a 6 mile descent into the
beautiful little town of Lexington, VA.  The descent was so steep that I
was going over 50MPH (the only one in our group to hit it, thanks to the
aerobars and full-size cranks!) for like a whole mile, absolutely
cruising through the turns at 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it leveled out, we were still hot and saw a very inviting river,
and since we were the first group decided to take a swim!&lt;/p&gt;

members, including two of the leaders, went/are going to UVA so they
know the area which is cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The ride here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took 15N for like 25 miles which wasn't super fun, but for the last
20 miles we turned onto some nice country roads which were awesome.
 Emma and I were both reminded of Blacksburg, as the roads were shaded
by the trees and there were some small hills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going up one of those hills, I happened to be riding with Caroline for
the first time when she broke her chain! Luckily, Mark also showed up
with a chain tool and I was able to get here bad link out, a new one in,
and she finished the day on it!! First time I've had to do it on the
road, and glad that I knew how to help her out.  She also happened to
take a slide off the road, and I got to use those four bads of medical
supplies that I brought to hook her up! The supplies are now in the
group med box, which is where I had hoped they could go all along, and I
haven't tried to put my box back together yet but it should be roomier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into town, I was riding with two wahoos, Will and Emily.  Emily
was suuper excited to be back in Charlottesville and lead us all into
town fast haha.  We stopped at the "lawn" and got a UVA history lesson.
 I was okay being on the road with four UVA people, but as I got closer
I had to put my Hokie arm warmers on and hold back to boo's haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overcame my predispositions though, got a bottled cheerwine, and admit
that it is a pretty cool town!  We got dinner at the Haven, and went out
to Southside bar (or something like that) and then to a karaoke bar.
 They couldn't talk me into singing, but it was a lot of fun haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite quote of the trip so far was the night before, when we all
laid down on our thermarests and I heard this psssssst sound and was
like "Someone is deflating!" Definitely had to be there, but it was
great lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Build Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip is partnered with Habitat in Charlottesville, and we give them
a yearly donation of \$35,000 in addition to two days of labor.  That
(32x2x8) 512 man-hours, one person would have to work for 13 weeks to
match that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three sites that we went to: a mixed income community close
to the town, a house they are reselling out in the booney's, and the
Habitat ReStore.  For the first day I worked on a house in the mixed
income neighborhood, and put up fireproofing external drywall because
the houses were too close by code.  It was pretty heavy, and we put up
scaffolding for the second floor and put Tyvek wrap over the whole
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was good, I really wished I had taken a time lapse of the whole
thing, it would've looked so cool going up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Build Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We switched up the groups and I went out to Louisa to help get a house
ready for some new occupants.  The grass hadn't been cut this year, and
it was up to my shoulder almost! When our person, Andrea, asked us who
wanted to mow I thought of how I liked mowing our yard and riding
around, so I volunteered.  She said the mower was in the shed, and I
headed to get it.  I was first thrown off by the fact that the door was
a foot off the ground...and when I opened the doors, a push mower!! And
I looked for that sticker that says "self-propelled"...but it was
nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I spent all day today doing what I think could be best described as
cutting through the Amazon forest with a push mower.  By lunch, there
was not a dry spot on my shirt! I worked that mower right into the
ground, until it starting spewing white smoke from burnin up all it's
oil.  The house looked way awesome after our group was done, with the
others mulching and spreading stone onto the pathways and cleaning and
weeding and weedwhacking while I was mowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight we had dinner at Bike and Build alumni's house, and it was
delicious! Our town hall meeting was great, and I'll end this post by
sharing my own highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lows: missing out on streaking the UVA lawn and the sprinkler park
today, and my performance in thumper lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highs: helping Caroline with her bike, and geniunly enjoying myself in
Charlottesville over the last few days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to: climbing hills tomorrow, leaving this time zone, and
the beard off that has begun with the men shaving tonight!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>To Dillwyn VA!</title><link href="/2010/05/24/to-dillwyn-va/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-24T19:14:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-05-24T19:14:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-05-24:/2010/05/24/to-dillwyn-va/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our forth day of biking in a row, I passed the discostick on to Jesse

for being so modest about how strong of cyclist he is this whole time
and for hacking into the army's network to give everyone internet last
night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a lot of major, busy roads so not that much exciting happened
on the road...I rode with Mark till lunch, we rode real fast for awhile,
it was gravy! For lunch I had an organic peanut butter, cream cheese,
jelly, and a nutrigrain bar in my super PBJ, not quite as intense as
yesterday but we were low on bread and that was all I could find haha,
it was reallly good though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with Mark's gatorade mix for today's electrolytes, it has been
gaining some hype and I'm not really lovin the mixes that I brought.  I
finished both of my bottles twice (before and after lunch) and that was
definitely a record so I think I'm going to stick with the gatorade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding into town, we had been riding real hard and saw a McDonalds that
was too tempting to pass up haha.  I could've very easily eaten
everything on the dollar menu (the "dollar menu challenge" that we were
talking about last night haha) but I only got some fries and a
mc-chicken.  When we got to the church, which was refreshingly close to
downtown after the 8 miles into the military base last night haha, all
of our gear was already unloaded which was nice, but there is NO room to
sleep tonight, it is going to be &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 4 of my personal push up goal was another success, I put in 60
push-ups and then I went on a cool down run with Sarah who has been
running every day after biking!  In between there I got in some good
stretching as well, I have been  stretching a lot this trip and I think
I can already feel that I'm more flexible.  I was pretty cooked
physically after all of this, needless to say haha, and hiked over the
pastor's house for a refreshingly cold hose shower lol.  Dinner crew was
out buying supplies during that time, and not long after I got back we
had an AWESOME meal of tacos! It was good...something for Taco Tuesday
to aspire to next year for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then we've been tossing around a frisbee and painting the van, and
I've been practicing the guitar (I learned six chords last night and now
I'm just trying to get quicker switching between them!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reflect on the trip as a whole, everything has been going awesome!!
Biking has been great, I have been able to help out a ton of people with
their bikes and setting up wordpress blogs haha. It really couldn't be
going any better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some pictures, not a lot, but I'm using Scott's tethered internet
so I'll try to get those up tomorrow when we get to Charlottesville!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Discostick Day!</title><link href="/2010/05/23/discostick-day/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-23T14:47:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-05-23T14:47:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-05-23:/2010/05/23/discostick-day/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every day of riding at our pre-ride route meeting with all 32, the group

awards a Lady Gage inspired "discostick" to a rider for something
special to carry with them riding that day.  The first day it went to
the rider who raised the most money for the trip, and yesterday she gave
it to Derrick because it was his birthday.  Today, Derrick gave it to me
for being a really nice all around person and especially helping
everyone out with the bikes!! Pretty awesome start to the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I packed my rain jacket with a forecast for rain, and sure enough it
started coming down not long after we had left at 7:30.  I caught up to
the front group, and as it started to really come down, four of us took
off.  It was pretty flat to start, and we were going a solid 25mph on
the flats and 22mph uphill! The rain coming off the rear wheels in front
of us got us all completely soaked, and it was actually pretty hard to
see, but we kept hammering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain started to clear up after awhile, and we had gone over 20 miles
by 8:30 and at 29 miles, we decided to call the van driver to see where
he was, because by my estimate we would be done with the ride by 10:10
if we held that pace. Derrick said he was at about mile 23, so we waited
at a nice spot for lunch for him to get there for 15 minutes, and at 9
we unpacked the van.  Lindsey and Scott are both hurting, Scott's knee
is bothering him and Lindsey threw out her hip after tripping on a wire
the first day, so they were riding in the van too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our average for that first leg of riding was just under 22, in the
pouring rain and it was definitely not flat haha.  Jesse was pulling
super hard towards the end, he's really strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited around awhile at lunch....since there was really no rush to get
to the host before the van haha and we had seen the last of the rain.  I
spent about two hours at lunch altogether helping Noah with his rear
brake.  I thought about it, and I like riding fast but it's really
pretty much a waste of effort since there is no reason to get to our
destination before noon lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain jacket I packed stayed strapped onto my saddlebag the whole
time, even through the pouring rain because we were riding so hard, I
was warm and didn't really mind being soaked.  That thing takes up so
much space...I thought that I might as well just mail it home, but there
will probably be days that I'll be glad to have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out with a group after awhile, and after a little while I got to
talking with Jen and didn't watch my effort and we had ridden away from
the group we were with, but we kept going and decided to just catch onto
the next one.  But, when I saw this town I had to stop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught up with the small group in front at an ice cream shop, and Jen
(different Jen) gave me the rest of her ice cream that she couldn't
finish, score!! I really wanted the double chili cheeseburger so I had
to hold myself back lol but not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, Jesse and Noah and I rode at a pace comfortable for the
whole larger group (12 riders?) but that's not like slow or anything,
just not hammering away haha.  The sun had come out strong and the rest
of the ride was a lot of fun talking and riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had packed up at night and laid out the clothes for the day, so I
could take my time getting around in the morning.  It's actually quite
a hand workout rolling up the thermarest and sleeping bag SUPER tight
though haha.  Breakfast provided by the church was great, and I did
manage to get a good bit down along with my vitamin, and I was proud of
myself after the 1.5 pounds of spaghetti from dinner last night haha.&lt;/p&gt;

The town we were headed to today is the tiny (3sq. mi.) town of Waverly,
VA, and the only real big attraction according to Emma who did the
research on this town was a "peanut museum..." So after unloading our
stuff at the church we are staying at, it was only 1PM and so to the
peanut museum we went!

&lt;p&gt;Then we came back to the church eventually, I was amazed at all of the
old stuff, even found an old outhouse on the nature trail out back...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner at the church was phenomenal, it consisted of macaroni and
cheese, green bean casserole, southern fried chicken, applesauce,
deviled eggs, chips and salsa, pretzels, potato salad, and normal salad
with pink lemonade to top it off! It's going to be tough to top that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set off from there with Mark, who was ready to get this show on the
road.  I managed the group's first flat tire about TWO MILES down the
road, and we found a big ol' chunk of glass in my rear wheel, thank VA
Beach! Got it changed quick though and we were on our way.  Mark and I
kept cruisin, starting at the very back after the flat, and caught up to
all but the lead group by the time we stopped for lunch, which was about
27 miles in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, again, was a blast and we're all pumped to take off tomorrow.

&lt;p&gt;We've been through the first day of orientation, a lot of getting to
know names and learning more about our trip that begins so soon!  I've
helped fix a lot of bikes, and distributed all 39 of the laundry loops
that I ordered for everyone too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I already know everybody's name, many I learned before the

friends, family, and Lauren for the last time before my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Wednesday and Thursday in Yorktown with Lauren, Friday at Busch
Gardens with Lauren and her brother, and came down with my parents to
our beach house Saturday, and my friends got here Saturday night.  It
was fun going around with Lauren, Busch Gardens was a lot of fun, and
the past two nights and hanging out with everybody has been a blast so
far.  I've snuck in bike rides pretty much every day, and the weather
has been beautiful with the exception of today, which has been raining
all day but now I gotta chance to blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Yorktown, VA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending most of the week at Lauren's house, I got to see most of the
town she grew up in.  Like most small towns in America, there isn't a
whole lot to do all the time, but I really enjoyed it!  Her house is
nice, and the hot tub was great haha.  We got out for 23 miles bike ride
(we! Lauren on the 1970's era 10-speed Motobecane) and that was nice,
the "tour roads" are a really nice place to get in some bike riding.  We
went down to historic Yorktown and saw the sights along the way, she was
my tour guide haha, and there's some pictures of what there is to see in
Yorktown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's pretty neat that her hometown has so much history, it's probably
pretty funny for her to show me around like a tourist haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my bike ride Saturday morning, I met some really cool people too.  I
rode for a little while with three older ladies who had biked across the
country before, and they were super nice and talked my ear off about
bike paths and rides haha.  I think Lauren could've held there pace, but
there had the right mindset, it was a beautiful morning for a ride and
they were in no hurry!  Later on, I was on my way back, and noticed that
my pedaling and clipping/unclipping with my left foot felt strange.
 When I stopped to take a picture of the surrender field sign, I looked
at my cleat and was missing a screw and it had slid real strange.  A guy
on a bike, Matt Kuivinen, asked me if I was OK and I told him I was
fine, but showed him how my cleat had messed up.  He suggested the I put
it back into the right position and crank it on with the remaining
screw, so I did that and it worked well.  Turned out he had all day and
was just out for some riding, so we rode back to Yorktown, rode a few
laps of some tour roads that made a decent crit course, and turned out
that he fixed machines for a living and so he probably had a screw with
him! We went back to his car which was on the beach (Yorktown beach) and
after 20 minutes of digging through tools and screws, found one that was
the right length, diameter, and head! It worked great, and we rode a few
more laps and I headed back to Lauren's house.  It was getting hot by
the time I got back at noon, and she was still at work, so I cleaned up
and got ready for my parents to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Busch Gardens!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tappans get unlimited passes every year which is pretty sweet, and
that actually gets me a discount too so Lauren, her brother and his
girlfriend and I went up there Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first ride they took me on haha:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I've been there but it was good, the roller
coasters were pretty crazy haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VA Beach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reluctantly put my bike back on the rack (I don't trust the rack or my
ability to secure it too much haha although it's made it pretty far),
and my parents brought me down to VA Beach and we got to go down to the
beach and relax for a little while.  Del, D-knick, and Zdan got here
late that night (this is Saturday) and we went down to the beach and
hung out for the night.  We caught a bunch of sandcrabs, master catcher
Delgiudice actually did most of the catching haha, and we didn't get
back to the beach house till like 2AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Grades&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the midst of it all, grades came out!  I finished up better than
expected, with an A in syntech, an A in Mass and Energy Balances, a B in
Calculus of Several Variables, an A in ES...and a B in Organic Chemistry
II, too bad he couldn't bump me up.  That put me at a &lt;strong&gt;3.56 for the
semester&lt;/strong&gt;, pulling my cumulative down to a 3.65 (it's been going down
since I got there haha), and I'm really proud of that! My classes were
challenging, and with amount of other work I took on....I'm happy.  I
got a little worried that I wasn't going to keep a 3.5 overall to apply
for a BS/MS program, but no worries there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Bike and Build is coming right up....I'll be there in &lt;em&gt;less than a

preparing for a cross country bike trip, and selling still more cycling
clothes I had no chance to blog but I'm now ready for the trip, done
with finals, and in Yorktown with my girlfriend at her house, the trip
leaves in ONE WEEK from VA Beach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;School&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass and Energy Balances: A.  My best class this semester, I didn't
really study at all for the final because I wanted to concentrate on
O'Chem and I only needed a 50-something on it to get an A in the class.
 Well, it was actually realllly hard and I was worried, but I got an 81
which left me with a 96 overall still haha, the class average at the end
was a 63.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic Chemistry: B-.  I studied really hard for the final, but somehow
did pretty poorly on it...and ended with an 82.4 which rounded down to
B- ...which was pretty dissappointing.  I accidentally missed one HW
assignment, and that was the difference, I went in and talked to my
professor but he can't really do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the only classes that I know my grades in....I'm still waiting
to find out what I got on the Calculus of Several Variables final, which
I studied all weekend for and think I did really well on.  I felt like I
walked out with a 100, but that usually isn't the case haha.  That final
can count up to 50% of our grade too!  Syntech lab and ES are totally in
the air too...I've always done well in ES and my grades have been good,
but every semester I've done 5 extra credits (the limit) which add 5
points to my final grade in the class...and this year I was more
involved but so busy that I only wrote one extra credit paper, so that
worries me a little.  I'm going to cut myself off of speculation here
haha....I'm just going to have to wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ES Action Project Manuscripts (which were ALOT of work) got put
together and published into a book!  The book came out really well, and
is our keepsake of sorts from the ES class.  The class series is over
now, which is sad, after four semesters of getting to know everyone it
had become a pretty tight-knit little community, but we'll still all see
eachother! Check out this article in&lt;a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/campus_notices/campusnotice.php?item=3016"&gt;VT
News&lt;/a&gt;
about the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cycling Clothing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday after my last final, I officially turned over all the clothes
(10 boxes), the two huge binders of orders, and a GIANT computer folder
full of spreadsheets...and went over the whole thing with her.  Sounds
like she's really excited for designing the kit this year, which sounds
like it is going to be sweet, she's going for a "retro" look!  Think
Team Radioshack in the Tour de Gila this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm glad that I did the clothing this year, but it was wayyyy
more work than I could've ever guessed.  There are a few reasons that I
think I made it so much more work, I'm pretty sure I ranted about them
in an earlier post though haha.  I think that kit came out really well,
and if anybody is still looking for one (we still have lots of
extra's...) email &lt;a href="mailto:aagraves@vt.edu"&gt;Ashton Graves&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bike and Build&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least! I've been spending the past few weeks
really getting ready for the trip, last Saturday I took a long ride with
Hayden Shea and Greg Pfister, and worked on my tan lines.  Squeezed in a
physical and PPD test at Schiffert, got my volunteer hours with Habitat
for Humanity in Roanoke signed off, and with everyone's help finished
raising \$4,000!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm really good to go...it's crazy now to think that in LESS THAN A
WEEK I'll be biking across the country...man did it sneak up on me.  I'm
&lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; excited for it though, and I'm going to miss my family, my
friends, and Lauren over the whole summer but it will hopefully be an
experience of a lifetime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I"m also really excited for my parents to come down to see me off, they
rented a beachhouse and my best friends are coming down too! And my
uncle Carl and Jean will be coming to the beachhouse to see me off as
well! Flattering for me that everyone is going to come down to see me
off on my trip, but I think they really just want to spend a few days on
the beach haha :-P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, I will be blogging every few days (as internet
access permits) during the trip so stay tuned!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And pictures!!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few random ones I could find on FB haha.&lt;/p&gt;

updating the &lt;a href="http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu"&gt;VT Cycling website&lt;/a&gt;,
studying for tests (lots of them), and planning the community bike ride
that went down last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've attached the 7-page manuscript describing the whole process that it
took to plan the ride, which is a pretty good read! Click here: &lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Tour-de-Blacksburg-Community-Bike-Ride-Manuscript.pdf"&gt;Tour de

&lt;p&gt;All in all, things have been going great, I did very well in Mass and
Energy Balances, well enough in Organic Chemistry, and am optimistic
about today's test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bike and Build trip is only 21 days away from right now...and there
is so much left to do!! Forms and making a presentation, and
training!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been healing up very well from when I got crashed out  in the
home race, and am thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, I needed to get something up here haha, more to come
hopefully!!&lt;/p&gt;

about all of the clothing stuff that has been going on....but haven't
had a chance and I probably won't, seeing as I have two tests in the

(clothes and racing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cycling Clothes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally they got here, but I was in Roanoke with Lauren when DHL was out
to deliver them.....and after many phone calls was able to get a hold of
Josh to be there and sign for them.  DHL called me when he got to Tech
about where to bring them, and thankfully all went smoothly because when
I got back at 6PM, there were 16 cartons in the hallway.  The 17th was
all Men's M jerseys, which were all extra so that was the best one they
could've not delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren and I spent that whole night counting the order, and putting
together individual orders, and by 2AM I called it a night, with just
people from the team's orders together for the race tomorrow.  The
system of putting orders together worked great, Lauren was crushing them
Friday and I got really fast putting them together Saturday and Sunday
when I spent probably 20 combined hours in the hallway assembling them.
 I got a good three hours of sleep Sunday night...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spent three or so hours at the post office shipping the
orders that needed to be shipped, writing the address (from and to) by
hand wasn't really that slow though, I just had &gt;50 to ship.  I made it
back in time for class, barely at 2:30, in pretty rough shape.  Monday
night I lugged the ones for pickup to the meeting, and got rid of a lot
of them!  So far, it's actually went pretty smoothly on the whole!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ACCC Conference Championships at Tech: Road Race and TTT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely was not my weekend for racing....Saturday on little sleep
and after being the lead vehicle for the B race (sitting for the three
hours prior to mine) I wasn't where I needed to be in terms of health or
fitness, and made it up the climb but not with the lead group.  We
worked to catch them, but it looked unlikely and I was doing almost all
the pulling....here's a picture of my race haha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_393" align="aligncenter" width="300"

finish"]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pain.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pain-300x232.jpg" title="pain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure where I finished...but it wasn't so great.  The TTT,
was is one of the most fun events out there and we only get to do one a
year, was a complete failure, dropping James in the first mile and then
Matt Londrey's shifter breaking...so we didn't hardly make it 5 miles
before turning around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday's Crit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Grandpa Frink CRC Safari" had some great potential, but short
story: a guy crashed and slid right under me, taking me out
completely....and so I was left with a DNF and no skin on my upper left
leg.  I was pissed.  I was scraped up, gloves ripped, bibs destroyed,
jersey ripped, jacket scraped, bike scraped up, pedal and cleat
broken....I don't even want to tally what it'll cost but all the clothes
were &lt;em&gt;brand new&lt;/em&gt; and I was feeling strong for the race, and this is
second race that Lauren has come to this year and my second crash and I
don't want her to think that bike racing is just crashing and getting
hurt....it's usually pretty fun haha.  Since we've been dating, every
race she's come to I've crashed haha....bad luck.  This scrape was
incredibly more painful that the last crash, and I'm pretty sure I
tweaked my right knee as well, but won't know for awhile until I get
back on the bike.  I'm alright really, just got two really nice and deep
scrapes on my upper left leg, which make it challenging to move my leg
very much....and are really just one more thing I'm going to have to
deal with these next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have pictures of my leg but they're pretty gruesome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one that Lauren took of the crit pre-crash:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Plan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty overwhlemed right now, with the clothing and two tests in the
next two days and our bike ride this Friday and trying to keep up with
all the Earth Week events and to be able to see my Lauren!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm going to keep limping around campus, working on clothing,
studying for my tests, promoting the ride, taking two weeks off the
bike, and hoping that this week comes to an end.  Apologies for the
pessimism haha, that's the mood I'm in.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Clothing Order Madness</title><link href="/2010/04/13/clothing-order-madness/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-13T17:42:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-04-13T17:42:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-13:/2010/04/13/clothing-order-madness/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started working to order clothes for the team this year, at the

beginning of the fall semester.  It has been an incredible roller
coaster, and I'm not done yet,  but can see the light at the end of the
tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons that the order this year has been so much more
difficult than last year, here are some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past summer, we had listed extra clothes on the website,
    and I got tons of emails about them.  I quickly sold all of those
    extras, but hung on to names and emails.  In this way, there are
    &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; more people who ordered clothes this year, beyond
    just the team.  Right now, I have 136 orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We switched companies this year, which made us jump through some
    hoops to pay them and just generally made it more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VT Purchasing Department couldn't get the lead out of their ass.
     (apologies for the language haha, it took them over three months to
    make the payment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to switch gears a little to keep this from being a
complain-fest haha.  A week ago, I got word from Funkier that the order
was done, and they were shipping it.  That was Thursday morning, and was
great news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I realized that I needed to figure out a way to keep track of who
needed what, to put the orders together, and ship them efficiently.  I
had wanted to find a way so that I didn't need to do it all by
hand...but couldn't really think of one.  So I took information from the
spreadsheet (which is pretty much unusable for practical purposes it is
so large), and put them into Word, with one order per page.  The goal is
that when the clothes get here, I can take each page with an order on
it, fill that order and put it in a plastic bag.  It has the name and
email and address on it, and the order itself so I can check it off as I
add things to that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a little over five hours of straight Alt+Tab and Ctrl+C and
Ctrl+V and typing to move all of the data.  It was painful, but I
listened to some music and just cranked that sucker out.  The result:
136 pages in a binder, each with the details of one order on it! Here's
a look at my own page haha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_385" align="aligncenter" width="300"
caption="My own order in the printed
form."]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clothing-order.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clothing-order-300x220.jpg" title="clothing order example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's my update haha, OH and tracking it...Monday I tried putting in
the tracking number in at DHL.com and couldn't find it, I called them
and after 15 minutes on the phone they couldn't find anything and so I
emailed Funkier.  It has shipped, just strangely, and as of April 11th
it was leaving Israel.  Things I'm scared about: paying the customs
charge (12% of invoice total) on a \$22K order....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come when it gets in!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_387" align="aligncenter" width="299"

clothes?"]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clothing_DHL_tracking.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clothing_DHL_tracking-299x256.jpg" title="clothing_DHL_tracking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent 30min on the phone with DHL...didn't really get an answer
as to where they were, other than that they might be between Germany and
the UK...but that's hard to see from above! They could be here as early
as tomorrow though! And the Winter Jackets from LG should be here
tomorrow for sure (UPS tracking doesn't suck).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Quick Race Recap: 5th place!</title><link href="/2010/04/12/quick-race-recap/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-12T04:04:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-04-12T04:04:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-12:/2010/04/12/quick-race-recap/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The "country roads" road race today was definitely out in the country,

&lt;h4&gt;Lap 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fiddleharpa.wordpress.com"&gt;Nick S&lt;/a&gt; and I started at the back of
the group, with the Women's B field haha, and chatted for the first fews
miles.  After turn 1, there was a small acceleration though, and they
were OTB (off the back) haha.  There were two climbs on the course, the
first being gradual and longer, and the second very steep, with gravel
at the top, but short.  As we hit the climbs, Nick and I moved up
through the field, nearer to the front, and on the steep gravel section
at the top of the second hill, 5 guys took off.  I was pretty far behind
them, Nick was with them for a little, but I decided to go for it and
accelerated over the top of the climb and put it into TT mode to catch
the break, passing Nick in the process.  There were 5 guys up, going as
hard as they could to get the gap, and I was really in no man's land a
half mile behind them... I biked harder than I ever have before in my
like, literally going 40MPH on the flats, trying to catch, and after 3
grueling miles caught them! I had nothing left in the tank...and pretty
much sat on.  We had a group of 6, with only 24 miles standing between
us and top 6 finishes haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lap 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the action took place on the hills, I fought hard to stick with
the group on the first hill, and did.  On the second hill as we hit the
gravel, myself and the guy from GW popped off, pushing as hard as we
could over the top.  We worked together really well to catch again,
after a few miles, but it wasn't anything like the first effort.  We
were both cooked by the time we caught, and again pretty much sat on the
back.  I took some pulls though, when I felt like I could.  Somewhere on
the flat-ish (it was all pretty rolling) we lost the GW guy and I was
looking at 5th if I could hang on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lap 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so tired that I had no real intentions of sticking over the hills,
but hoped to get far enough away from anyone else to secure that 5th
spot.  Near the top of the first hill, I'd had enough, and told the
other four I'd see them at the finish haha! I worked up the next steep
hill, and after coming over the top without being able to see anyone
coming up the climb, I gave everything else that I had left in a TT-like
effort over the last few miles, and rode painfully through the line for
5th!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of the toughest races I've done....never again do I really
want to chase down a strong break when I'm out of shape, but it was a
fun day and I'm definitely pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad my parents came down, I can barely move in my dorm room

&lt;p&gt;I didn't have high expectations, but it's still really hard not being
able to get on the break, and suffering on the wheel of the "chase"
group, when weeks ago I would've been crushing it in the break.  Not
sure where I finished, don't really care at moment, not point-worthy for
sure (15th maybe?).  I'm blaming it on myself here, but I did get
23.5MPH for my &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; speed, which is crushing with the tight turns
and small hills, above my TT pace haha.  Having cadence was nice, I
noticed that I liked to go at about 110 the whole race! Missed
&lt;a href="http://mydailyground.com"&gt;Brett&lt;/a&gt; at the race this weekend too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Jean and Don and my parents came down for the race!!
And the weather and race were awesome, it was right in the downtown, set
up awesome, and I got four free hamburgers lol, as well as a few free
ones for my dad and mom! It was great to see them again after so long :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cycling team's hotel was pretty sketchy, (6 people per small,
smelly-ish room), and I opted to stay with my parents tonight after
having Zach cuddle with me and snore like a freight train 6 inches from
my face haha, got one of the worst nights sleep in a long time haha.
 Much improved haha in a Hilton that is HUGE and my own bed.  We got
dinner tonight, and it was really good, and we caught up on all that
we've been up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my evident lack of training and/or fitness, I'm just going to relax
in the road race tomorrow and not try anything crazy (other than to
finish!).  Congrats to &lt;a href="http://bigwatts.blogspot.com"&gt;Reid&lt;/a&gt;, Matt
Dockins, and Ben Rice for strong finishes in the A, B and C fields

month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Worried...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, since William and Mary and the crash, I wasn't able to ride my
bike very well for like 3 weeks.  I have been doing some training, but
Wednesday I went out and bonked hard on a ride that wasn't super hard.
 I don't think I'm in great shape...and so it's gonna hurt haha.  I'm
still optimistic, but am lowering my expectations of winning haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But still excited, because&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even though I don't expect to ride very fast (or place) my parents and
Jean are going to be there! My parents are coming to see me race and to
switch cars...I'll be driving the Subaru out there but driving my good
ol' Accord back.  I missed the stickshift.  They're also bringing a lot
of stuff down, which should be good....I wish my speakers would fit in
the dorm room but I don't think they're going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other exciting news!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've failed to update the blog every day already for the month (7/9 days
now haha)...that's really hard to do though, BUT as of yesterday morning
the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VT CYCLING CLOTHES WERE

and all 17 crates are coming to the 7th floor of Lee Hall via UPS! Poor
delivery guy haha....the only thing I'm worried about is that they may
need customs payment to deliver the order, which is 12% of the invoice
total (\$22k).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

is going in there (minute by minute updates) I'm going to re-focus more
on issues, thoughts, and cooler stuff that I do.  I don't really think
anyone cares what I did at 4:54 PM yesterday... So today, I reflect on
the ideas surrounding sustainability and where I go to school, Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is sustainability, really?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, when you think about "sustainable,"what are your first
associations? (answering a question with a question haha). I would
venture a guess that most people think of "being green," priuses, and
buying food labelled "organic."  I really don't know though. What I can
say is that less than 10% of Americans think the environment is
American's biggest problem right now (most go with economy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I say sustainable, I mean things are closed cycle, socially
just, and community-oriented.  Most people would say (I hope) that we
live in the most advanced society ever, but I can't say with certainty
that as a nation we are happier or more fulfilled than ever before.  Are
the reasons that underly this human nature, and that we are stricken
with some human condition that leads us to fight wars and torture
people. even though we can create ununseptium (newest element, got made
just a few days ago I think)? Again, a question that I can't answer.  So
more or less, sustainable design to me uses the breadth of human
knowledge to create communities that self-reliant, fulfilling, and
pleasant to live in.  "Going without" doesn't have anything to do with
what I consider to be green, unless that without is referring to
McDonald's of course haha, but rather the sustainability movement with
which I associate myself encompasses all areas of life, taking on more
than just the purely environmental challenges of society, recognizing
where we have failed and relying again on our knowledge and our belief
system to engineer a better future.  Hopefully this is clearer with some
examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What it all comes back to&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining in depth the issues which confront the environment and
America, and looking for a more sustainable solution, the problems can
all be said to stem from the way in which we design spaces &lt;strong&gt;[the built
environment]&lt;/strong&gt;, and how many people we're building that for
&lt;strong&gt;[population]&lt;/strong&gt;.  And the third leg of sustainability, what we value
socially, morally and religiously [&lt;strong&gt;core values&lt;/strong&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The built environment&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with alternative transportation, and how Blacksburg and other
cities are designed (not so much designed, but more or less have
fallen), and examining other issues as well has reinforced my belief
that our very need for transportation over long distances (20 miles to
work every day, 5 miles to the grocery store, and 7 miles to go hang out
with Bob) every day is a &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; of design.  Electric vehicles,
partnered with clean energy generation, have the potential to reduce
green house gas emissions from such trips...but should that be the end
goal?  Coming to college, it has been an unbelievably awesome experience
to live in the same building as 800 of my peers. being so connected with
something always to do, yet most American's dream of suburbia where they
have their own house, isolated from the social interaction possible in a
dormitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose instead that we design cities that are walkable, bike-able,
and are connected cultural centers where people can live, work, and play
at the same time.  Sounds dreamy, but really it's just denser living
which completely eliminates the need for elaborate, and inefficient,
modes of transportation.  Tech has sprawled over the years, and for most
people it is unreasonable to walk to classes from their apartment or

&lt;p&gt;1:00 AM going to sleep after getting back from a weekend at the beach
and getting settled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 AM alarm goes off, but don't want to get up so put it on snooze&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 AM now too late for D2 breakfast or to wet shave, decide to sleep
for another 15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:45 AM rush out of bed, get dressed and on the bike to head to to 8AM
class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:46 AM start day 1 of my photo project, by taking a picture of myself
at arms lenght with the the "canon" at eye level. I plan to take them
daily for a few months and combine into a time lapse.  we shall see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:53 AM get to class early!! brought the bike into class, came in the
back door and left the bike in the back of the room, but he's just
handing out tests until:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:04 AM get my mass and energy balance test back and got a &lt;strong&gt;100!&lt;/strong&gt; my
raw was a 96, and he curved the &lt;em&gt;class average 56&lt;/em&gt; to a 62, so I got two
points added on to the last test since Blackboard (online grading
system) can only handle 100 lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:30 AM doodling in class, taking notes, and plan out my agenda for the
rest of the day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:50 AM bike back to Lee, it's warmed up to like 70s. some guy walked
out in front of me and I locked my rear wheel hard and powerskidded
across the drillfield.  the near death experience wakes me up a little
more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:55 AM back in the room, try to decide whether to get breakfast at d2
or hold out for lunch...the banana I ate in mass and energy will have to
suffice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:57 AM open mail.andyreagan.com to 38 new emails...sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:15 AM after sorting and replying to tons of email, quite a few about
VT cycling jerseys :), decide to start on the &lt;a href="https://scholar.vt.edu/access/content/group/3b711cc8-ae2f-4ab9-8153-72d41f073404/Homework%20assignments%20and%20solutions"&gt;Vector Calc
HW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:20-11:20 work solid on the HW...learning a lot from the book and
txting some ppl to keep my busy.  waiting to see if Stephan responds so
I can go check out his MTB and to see if &lt;a href="http://www.kdshields.com/"&gt;Kieth
Shields&lt;/a&gt; is at Tech so I could show him
around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:25 AM stephan responds, and so I hop on my bike to go out to Foxridge
to check out his MTB for sale, meet him at owens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:30 AM on the way out to Foxridge to check out the bike, absolutely
beautiful day outside...I'm hungry though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:40 AM riding the MTB around the parking lot...the brakes are pretty
iffy and the shifting isn't great. for \$200...idk, I tell Stephan I'll
think about it and let him know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:00 PM back at campus, call Ruthie to see where she wants to meet,
which is Torg but we compromise at Owens so I can get food&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:05 PM bike tied outside owens, having brought my vector calc stuff
after I left Lee, head in to get food.  all the lines are pretty
long...so I just get pasta (no line!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:10 PM eating and waiting for Ruthie, she shows up after a little
while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:20 PM she's gotten food, and we go over the HW problems that were the
most troublesome.  for once, the help is evenly spread I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:05 PM we finish up a pretty productive study session at owens, and I
head to Lee Hall to grab a VT shirt before heading to the engineering
open house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:20 PM back to Lee, up to my room, back down and over to squires I
prepare to recruit prospective students into galileo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:21 PM grab a &lt;a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/"&gt;CT&lt;/a&gt; on the way in, and
the open house is actually pretty empty (not suprising since it's 85 and
sunny out).  I read pretty much the whole
&lt;a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/"&gt;CT&lt;/a&gt;...some interesting stuff. it's not
very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:15 PM after recruiting some freshman into Galileo, head to Vector Calc
class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:20 PM the earliest i have ever been to this class, I start txting both
shields and Lauren and javier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:30 PM dr floyd shows up right on time as always, and despite txting
the whole time, I had a front row seat and interacting with dr floyd a
lot during class, answering questions and i followed everything.
 probably the best class yet, understanding-wise, and no doubt in my
mind that it was from doing 3 hours of HW for that class during the
day...my blood was running with surface integrals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:30 PM get an email that I got a package, always exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:45 PM class actually ran all the way today, for like the first time,
and I hop back on the bike to go see how Lauren is doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:50 PM she's not feeling well and has a lot of work to do today, never
a good combination, and is trying to relax under a tree on the
drillfield before her 4PM class, I walk with her to class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4PM head to owen's mailroom to pick up my package, sure enough it's a
big one from Amazon! so tempted to open it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:05 PM go wait at the chapel for people who didn't get my email about
changing the time of the SAYG ride I posted from 4:15PM to 5:15PM so
that &lt;a href="http://mydailyground.com"&gt;Brett&lt;/a&gt; could come.  I sit in the
beautiful day and open the package, and put the tail lights together.
 altogether the box includes three tail lights, lauren's helmet, her
speedometer, a front bike light, my new cyclocomputer, and I'm sure some
other stuff i forgot about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:18 PM will massey shows up, and I tell him about the change of time.
 I think he headed out for a ride anyway, nbd, i just didn't want to
leave anybody stranded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:30 PM back to Lee and up in the room, begin getting ready for my ride
and putting away some of the stuff I got.  I go to put the cyclocomputer
on, but want to take my time and do it right and don't really have time
before the ride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:00 PM Lauren comes up after her class to take a nap, where she won't
sleep too long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:05 PM Hayden comes to my room, and we pump up his tires and head over
to the chapel for the ride. I wake up Lauren before we leave...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:17 PM &lt;a href="http://mydailyground.com"&gt;Brett&lt;/a&gt; shows up to the ride...and we
wait for about two more minutes but no one shows.  Head out tom's creek
rd to do the regular SAYG loop.  the sun has gone away a little....and
rain is threatening but we go regardless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:45 PM a beautiful overcast condition to ride in (serious haha),
&lt;a href="http://mydailyground.com"&gt;Brett&lt;/a&gt; outsprints me to a town sign right
before we get onto the &lt;a href="http://www.huckleberrytrail.org/"&gt;Huck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:55 PM starts to rain pretty good on the trail...but we're not on
roads, and we won't melt so
&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nbd"&gt;nbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00 PM the rain turns to small hail, and it hurts!! we take refuge
under 460&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitvid.com/player/CKCLG"&gt;http://www.twitvid.com/player/CKCLG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:05 PM we venture out again, but the hail starts coming even harder and
luckily theres another small tunnel right ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:10 PM soaking wet, the hail starts getting bigger and bigger, and wind
begins to pick up, blowing it straight through the tunnel! freezing cold
and getting pelted with golf balls of hail, having to yell to hear Brett
or Hayden...it's crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_349" align="aligncenter" width="226"

&lt;p&gt;6:20 PM we venture on...and make it back.  the clouds clear completely
and it's back to warm sunshine! hayden and I head back to the dorms and
then straight to d2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 PM David Lynch joins on his birthday and we eat a glorious feast at
Dietrick 2. (no one actually knows what d2 really stands for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:25 PM check mail on the way back, and my MTB pedals are in the
mailbox!! along with 5 letters which are presumably for cycling
clothing.  I'm feeling popular haha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:40 PM do some cycling stuff, think about what we can talk about, about
the website, at the meeting and draft a few new designs on paper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:15 PM cycling meeting is pretty chill, don't do a whole lot....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 PM get ice cream at Deets with
&lt;a href="http://bigwatts.blogspot.com/"&gt;Reid&lt;/a&gt;, Ben Rice, &lt;a href="http://bspt-jacob.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jacob
Aber&lt;/a&gt;, Tyler, Zach Morrey, and &lt;a href="http://fiddleharpa.wordpress.com/"&gt;Nick
S&lt;/a&gt;...cookies and cream heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 PM back at the dorm room, clean off the bike and put on the new
speedometer, carefully taking my time.  the head unit is tiny, I really
like it. I'm pretty interested to see what my cadence is like on the
road...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00 PM head down to Lauren's room to say goodnight...talk for a little
while.  she's finishing up her essay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:30-now PM write an excruciatingly detailed post about my productive
day!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, hope you enjoyed haha, one of these days maybe I'll try to tweet
my whole day lol.  If every day was like this, I'd get a lot done... K

so bear with me as I follow through on my promise to update the site
every day haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up real early with hopes to take a time lapse of the sunrise on
the ocean but it was suuuper foggy, so no beans there.  Lauren and her
Mom and grandparents went to the 7AM nondenominational service, I didn't
go because I was planning on going to mass later anyway, I should've
gone though haha it was only half an hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had scouted out the Catholic church, and service was at 9
and 11 so when Lauren came back from her early service we heated up some
&lt;em&gt;DELICIOUS&lt;/em&gt; corncakes and apple desert from the night before, yum yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass was nice, it was outside where all the masses are there, and we
still had to stand on the railing 20 minutes early! Must've been a day
of obligation or something jeez...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we played some really intense games of rummikub, her grandpa
beating up on us haha, and he showed me the research that they had done
on the impacts of what he did, which was develop polymers for aviation
at NASA Langley, really neat.  Developed the very resins that I'm racing
on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day we spent hanging out on the beach, and while we were
down there we saw dolphins like 50 feet from shore!! They were sooo
close, I ran partly into the icy water, and could've swam right with
them....but was a little afraid to haha.  Then we reluctantly packed up
to return to the real world....and survived the 6 hour drive home,
keeping eachother going. We stopped at Cracker Barrel so I could get a
country fried steak as my (well, second) meal with meat after Lent, and
it was gooood!  We got back late, and now I'm trying to get to bed haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some of the pictures from last night walking around the tip of
the island!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey so I can’t get onto AndyReagan.com with the phone right now (I need
to go change a setting and don’t have internet lol)…so here goes my
first post with the phone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend Lauren invited me to come to her beach house (thanks
Lauren!) and it has been really fun so far. Since typing on the
touchscreen is not my favorite thing either haha here’s a list of some
of the things we’ve got to try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-spend lots of time together on the 6 hour ride haha&lt;br&gt;
-i tried oyster, crab cakes, mahi mahi, and I’m sure some other seafood
at dinner Friday night and it was all really good, thanks for the dinner
Lauren grandparents!&lt;br&gt;
-got buried in the sand today by Lauren haha&lt;br&gt;
-swam (froze) in the 50 degree ocean in April…&lt;br&gt;
-saw a huge pack of dolphins!!! had to be like 15, and I couldve swam
right out to them they were so close&lt;br&gt;
-walked around the south shore of the island which was fun&lt;br&gt;
-tried a bunch more foods tonight and am drinking sweet tea, my
southern roots makin a comeback I guess lol&lt;br&gt;
-stayed undefeated in games at the beachhouse, winning rummikub, hand
and foot with Lauren, against Lauren in connect four (although she beat
me twice…so I guess not undefeated…she thinks that I let her win, but I
didn’t…but if she thinks I did then ill maintain that I am undefeated
lol), and I taught Lauren how to play chess haha&lt;br&gt;
-and just hanging out on the beach was sweet, I think a stogie wouldve
perfected it haha jk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here’s some pics I took!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;think I deleted a couple by accident haha idk…anyway thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was up late at 2am finishing an essay, and Chris Brown sent out an
email to the listserv saying that he was tired of having all this extra
triathlon team clothing, and was just putting the whole box outside,
first come first serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desperately looking for a break from the computer screen, I hopped on my
bike and rode the two miles out to his house.  It was pitch black, and a
crisp but warm night, without a car in sight.  The ride was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got there, I found a giant cardboard box with a flap on the
front, labeled "Free Swag" and so I opened it, to find a &lt;em&gt;DEAD ANIMAL&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Chris heard me and came out, and I had brought his bibs so I
gave them to him. He laughed a little, as I was the first person to come
at 2am haha, and out of sympathy, ended up giving me a shirt. Wearing
the shirt today, I convinced two people that there was still free stuff
and to go check it out haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wednesday Worlds&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you've never heard, every Wednesday (except winter) the
Blacksburg and VT cycling community comes together for a mock race ride
at 5:30! It's race pace, which is crushing when the likes of &lt;a href="http://www.johndelong.us/"&gt;John
Delong&lt;/a&gt; (ex-pro) is hitting it hard.  But I
went to give it a try, my knee was feeling good again, after going on a
hilly ride with Greg Pfister Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride started out good, I was wearing the &lt;a href="http://tweetphoto.com/16579718"&gt;full Tech
kit&lt;/a&gt;, which had come in at 3PM! The
group only half made it through a stop-light, and the other half just
blew it except for me and two other people who put on the brakes...so
even before the ride we had to TT up to the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride splits into two and the "b" group gets a 5 minute head start on
the "a" group.  I rode with the b's and it was too fast for a lot of
people who dropped off, but we got a pretty solid paceline going and
although I tried to speed it up, we only held a pretty moderate pace.  I
did a pretty solid share of work, more than i ever do in real races, and
didn't realize that there was a sprint at the end so I just rolled the
midway sprint in 4th haha.  At which point, we turned around, and had
actually beat the a's there!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the A's got there, this guy Andrew and Zach Morry rode off, and I
sprinted up to them, and then it was just us and &lt;a href="http://fiddleharpa.wordpress.com"&gt;Nick
Shoemaker&lt;/a&gt; off to the races to the
finish on the way back! It was super fast, I pulled super hard, and this
part was a lot of fun.  I didn't they were going to catch us at all it
took so long, we stayed out for like 10 miles, and finally Reid blew by
us.  I put the hammer down and chased down Reid, at which point Andrew
attacked and my legs were doneski.  We were at the base of Harding by
that point, and I was cooked from being in the break so long...so I just
took it real easy up the hill, although my knees starting hurting bad
about halfway up the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overdid it a little I think, but don't think I've ever rode much
harder, and it was a great workout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;A new mini-pledge&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another thing that I've noticed is that I've become really skinny
from all this cycling business, and that's really my natural build...so
I started on Wednesday my goal of &lt;em&gt;DOING A PUSHUP FOR EVERY MILE I
RIDE&lt;/em&gt;.  That was 40 pushups on Wedensday, and the results aren't huge
yet, but it'll be a good goal for this summer when I'm doing 100 mile
days haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also unsuccessfully tried to go to bed at 12 every night this
week....very unsuccessfully and with a test tomorrow that I know none
of, and just got an email saying he will not be giving us any formulas
on, doesn't look like I'll be getting my 8 hours tonight either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of other stuff going on, but it's hard to type up my life lol! I'm
going to try to post every day this month though!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Life as a Math Major</title><link href="/2010/03/31/life-as-a-math-major/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-31T00:43:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-03-31T00:43:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-31:/2010/03/31/life-as-a-math-major/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since my last post, and my decision to become a math major, things

&lt;p&gt;After next semester (those purple classes) I'll be done with everything
but straight Math! And if I want a Chemistry minor, I can add a Chem
class that is on there now.  I have a Green Eng minor in the back of my
mind...which I could try to do too, I will have some flexibility.  I
really see no reason not to graduate in three and half years, but what I
could do is this BS/MS 5-year program from the Math Dept.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Math or Chemical Engineering</title><link href="/2010/03/26/math-or-chemical-engineering/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-26T01:59:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-03-26T01:59:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-26:/2010/03/26/math-or-chemical-engineering/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems like since I have come to college, I have become less sure of

what I want to do when I graduate.  I never imagined that I would be one
of the many who dropped engineering, or ever be part of the statistic of
the average college student changing majors 3 times, but here I am  at
the crossroads of a mathematics and a chemical engineering degree.  I've
put an incredible amount of thought into this, more than I ever have, as
it may be one of the biggest decisions I'm having to make so far, talked
to my parents a lot, and spoke to professors in math about the program
for awhile.  A lot of it comes down to what I want from life, be it
happiness or money or flexibility or low-stress, and certainly none of
things are seperate. In my mind, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_230" align="aligncenter" width="243"

choose..."]&lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/crossroadsoflife.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/crossroadsoflife-243x300.jpg" title="crossroadsoflife"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't see, click on the picture haha, one side is a chemical
factory and the other is a crazy old professor teaching math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why I have to decide now&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I need to choose a mathematics major or a chemical engineering
major, and not keep both, is because in the next two years of doing
both...my course load is going to get very intense, and I will probably
hate my life during my junior year. I don't see a math major being
hugely attractive to chemical engineering, nor do I see any need to have
a chemical engineering degree to teach math.  If I keep chemical
engineering and decide to go to grad school for math, that is going to
make it more difficult because if I focused on math now, I could surely
keep my GPA higher to have a better chance to get into grad school.  If
I'm doing chemical engineering, advanced calculus and modern algebra are
going to kill me. Also, course request for the fall is going on now
though the 30th...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But it's not that big of a decision anyway, right?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Pretty much what I decide to do now is going to determine what I
end up doing for the rest of life, and that's important stuff! When
deciding, the easiest thing to do is not decide and continue with both,
but again that is not going to help either.  When I'm working my ass of
in grad school, or my beeper goes off at home and I have to go back into
the factory...I'm going to have to think back to this point.  The
pressure just makes it even harder to pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What scares me about both&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chemical Engineering, most of the graduates go into petrochemicals.
Some go into pharmaceuticals, some go into green stuff, and a few go to
grad school. Those are the facts. I definitely do not want to work in a
factory, it doesn't really seem appealing when I do have so many options
and my dad, who did the factory thing, said it's the one thing to avoid.
I don't see any intellectual freedom in that, and no doubt the hours are
long.  Even with the other options available to the chemical engineering
graduate, there is no avoiding the 8-5 workday, 5 days a week...
(actually, I heard Eastmont did 4 10hr days, and 3 off but that's
besides the point).  Working on the green aspects of ChE involves
working either with or for the FDA, attempting to measure, determine
effects of, and regulate the chemicals in our environments, at the
workplace, and under our kitchen sinks.  And sure, I can be doing
something to help the environment, but I don't really want to be dealing
with regulations all the time either....doesn't sound like much fun.
 The most exciting side would be working on renewable energies...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mathematics major, both my parents and I have learned that there
are job opportunities with an undergraduate degree, but the scariest
part about this career path is that it relies on me getting into grad
school.  I'm getting by in Calculus of Several Variables, and I got made
it through Proofs, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt;
those classes.  I can rock basic calculus, but this upper level stuff is
really theoretical and it's difficult to see line integrals in 3 space
in my head...but I do think that the problem may be that I'm not really
devoting enough time to the HW to understand it...and switching into
math would help me concentrate on those courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Will I regret two years of wasted engineering courses?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely not! Right now, it's going to be hard to keep working in my
classes that aren't going to be useful to me anymore...but living in
Galileo and meeting so many friends through engineering was something I
never would have had coming in as a math major.  The "engineering
mindset" of building and tinkering with stuff all the time doesn't have
to change, and I won't lose any of that if I'm not an engineering major.
 I just looked, and after this semester I can pick up a chemistry minor
with one more course for a total of 22 credits in Chemistry, which may
be something I would pursue.  If I can find a fun sounding chemistry
course, I'll take it haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My decision&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have chosen to drop chemical engineering and plan my
courses for the fall in mathematics!  This is still not entirely set in
stone...but I have done my homework, talking to quite a few people in
the mathematics department, and am excited to be a math major!  My
courseload is going to lighten significantly, and there may be some
points where I'm looking for courses...I'm definitely going to try to
get into "Brewing Science" haha, I've heard it's pretty awesome, and
maybe I'll try to take "Mysterious Mushrooms and Molds" which I've heard
is pretty awesome.  I am definitely going to try to get into some
research in the fall, which I think is going to be the most helpful
thing in making sure that I want to pursue mathematics, because at the
university level, in any tenure track positions, research is big must.
 And, it'll be pretty necessary to get into grad school. My fall is
going to look like this: Modern Algebra, Linear Algebra, Undergraduate
Research, and Brewing Science.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Survived 3 tests this week!</title><link href="/2010/03/25/survived-3-tests-this-week/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-25T20:28:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-03-25T20:28:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-25:/2010/03/25/survived-3-tests-this-week/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a rough week, with tests in ES, Calculus of Several Variables,

&lt;p&gt;Big news this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was Lauren's birthday this week! She's 20!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We (as a committee) did a good chunk of the work making a new site
    for the Newman Catholic Community!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only slept 15 hours the past three nights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm going to get free pizza tonight hopefully haha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spoke with Dr. Sue Hagen and Dr. Bud Brown about becoming a math
    major and teaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I applied for a job! As a part-time mechanic at Hokie Spokes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still working hard planning a Community Bike Ride for April 23rd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(gasp) I didn't train on my bike at all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lauren and I went for a 5 mile ride out the huck, on her mom's bike
    that I fixed up, and it still needs some work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuthin but NET (our intramural innertube waterpolo team) dominated
    on Tuesday, two more games to win it all&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel confident in my cycling strength, although my knee has been
giving me lots of trouble since going down in the race at William and
Mary. My left one in particular, is very painful still, and it will be
two weeks since the crash, so hopefully it starts feeling better soon.
My shoulder has healed over completely, and my right leg looks and feels
good, it's been downgraded to bandaid status, I'm still trying to keep
hydrocolloid on the left one. I just want to be healed already...it's a
pain to deal with, but hopefully by next weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our deadline to have \$2000 raised is Monday, and right now I have
\$1925 raised! So I'm pretty much on track, and hopefully will be
sending letters out to family soon, to raise the remaining \$2075.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the "Sweat Equity" requirement, which involves spending a
minimum of 10 hours helping out local affordable housing organizations
before the summer, I spent the day today in Roanoke with the Habitat for
Humanity there.  It was another good experience with Habitat, and
counting the fall work, I have the 10 hours but plan to continue with
more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Community Bike Ride update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in other happening this week, my ES group, our advisor Cortney
Martin, and Beth Lohman and Ed Hokanson from the NRVBA met to finalize
the ride plans. We decided to lead smaller groups, since the cops are
allowing "no bike events in the downtown" and the NRVBA is going to
sponsor the event, meaning there will be helmets required and hopefully
the ride will leave from the GLC Lawn or the Drillfield, Click
on &lt;a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/flyer.pdf"&gt;Community Bike Ride
flyer&lt;/a&gt; for a
very tentative flyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran into many obstacles planning the ride with town, and it really
pretty disappointing it is to plan an event, and how unsupportive the
Town and Police towards a community bike ride... but after some gloomy
moments, I do think it's going to happen.  It is disappointing for us
that it isn't going to be one big group, and the whole difficulty of the
process for something so simple, and how insurance and liability becomes
such a big issue, and so it is also hard for us as students, who are
usually only in Blacksburg for four-five years.  The "long-term" seems
pretty lame, but I do think that getting this off this year will be a
start to bigger and better rides.  The next step may be to have the
co-op lead monthly community rides, although they definitely would be
more of the unorgized "critical mass" rides.  There is tension between
achieving visibility for cycling and pissing off drivers, and in no way
does blocking the streets and making people mad do anything for cycling
or to lessen the tensions between cyclist and motorist, which are
unnervingly tense (think Lance Armstrong and Tony Kornheiser going at it
on TV this week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other news&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get a chance to go out to Roanoke on Monday as well, and picked up
some new handlebar tape and hoods.  All white! It looks sweet in person,
but has ALREADY not as white as new haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math HW that was due Wednesday consumed a significant amount of my
time this week, it was a bitch, but I'm pretty sure I figured it out.  I
also spent some time, a few hours, fixing up Lauren's bike and with a
new tube, it should be good to go!!  Also, in the coming weeks I'll be
working to help redesign Newman's website, and maybe it will give me
some inspiration to write my own Wordpress theme! (we will be writing
the theme for that site from scratch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also up for election Monday to be an officer on the cycling team,
which I already am but I'm switching haha, to either Webmaster,
Sponsorship or President.  Both Ben Warren and David Henry are running
for President, and both will be excellent presidents, right now they are
VP's of the mountain and road team right now.  So I will probably
withdraw from that race, and am unnopposed currently for the other two
haha.  I think that I would enjoy being webmaster, and I think
sponsorship wouldn't be so bad either! In fact, I think that those two
need to work together well to integrate sponsors to the webpage, and
create system to keep track of donors and sponsors for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall end with a song that has been stuck in my head all week, see if
you can guess who it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news concerning my life, I got a 92 on my Mass and Energy exam,
which was extra exciting considering the class average was a 65.5...and
Experimental Organic Chemistry Synthesis and Techniques lab is still
sucking my life (so much time and work), but today was really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I drove up to Roanoke with Brett and got some new bar tape for
my bike, all white, it looks sick! &lt;a href="http://tweetphoto.com/14540983"&gt;Here's a
twitpic&lt;/a&gt; of it, but that doesn't do it
any justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for a long ride Sunday, like 53 miles and I really overdid
it...my knee started hurting a lot on the way back...so I'm going to
stay off it, not race this weekend and take it from there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm getting ready for the battering of tests I have next week, with

&lt;p&gt;Getting up early to teach wasn't so hard, because I'm used to getting up
early from both classes and from racing.  But because my wounds were
leaking some hydro-colloid, I didn't want to wear my nice new dress
shirts, so I wore sweatpants underneath my khakis and two undershirt
under a polo.  For the first few days we, basically observed class, and
it felt a lot like being back in high school, but East Montgomery is
worlds different than Marcellus and I was looking at it from the other
side: teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Montgomery (EastMont) is classified as a high needs school, because
many of the students come from very low-income families and it is a
small school, graduating only 50 students per year.  I learned a ton
from the experience, am considering teaching (possibly at the high
school level) but am probably going to steer clear of the high-needs
schools if that is what I do.  We actually had to keep journals of our
experiences, which I'll quote from include at the end to summarize the
week, which is pretty much what today's journal was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday night Dave cooked most of dinner, with me and Arturo out in the
kitchen helping.  It was really good! &lt;a href="http://tweetphoto.com/13746372"&gt;Here's a link to a picture of our
homemade meal.&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday night we cooked
dinner for Dave so it was ready when he got home, attempting again to
make break, which came a little salty and dense haha, but still alright!
 Then Wednesday I got out for a 20mile ride at 4:30, having to put the
new bars, open my brakes, and wipe some of the blood off the bike
(there's still a lot on there now...), and get ready to ride which was
more than I had planned.  But I got out, and got a really great ride
with Jim Stoll, who is a grad student at Tech.  I missed dinner with the
other interns and math-ed grads, and so Dave and I went out to Mike's,
but that was closed, so we went to Backstreets.  We tried to see who
could drink the most water, but we couldn't really get fast enough
service to test the limits haha, Dave finished with 8 glasses and we
only had enough to fill 7 and 3/4 of my glasses haha, so I guess he won.
 Then Thursday, I went out to Panera with Arturo with the math-ed grads,
but only one of them ended up making it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Arturo and I went to Carol Lee's to try and get some free donuts,
knowing that they closed at 5:30 we showed up at 5:29 and the dude gave
us a whole huge box of them!  Then I went over to Catherine's dorm,
where her, Emma, and I all had dinner and talked about Bike and Build
and how excited we all are to be doing it this summer!!  Then tonight
I'm just layin low I guess, did a lot of clothing order stuff and am
still putting off doing real homework haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I reflect on the crash, the better I feel about how I came out
of it.  I didn't break any bones, didn't hit my head at all, and didn't
really lose tooo much skin.  The hydrocolloid bandages are supposed to
work wonders, I went to Schiffert on Monday and they hooked me up with a
bunch, and I've been tending to them all week.  I've made a lot of
progress, from barely being able to move Monday, to going on a 20mi bike
ride Wednesday, to being able to lift my arm straight up today (although
painfully).  I took some pictures, which I'm going to include next,
after a disclaimer haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Teaching Journal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't really feel like editing it, here is my &lt;em&gt;uncensored&lt;/em&gt; Noyce
journal entry, it should give a glimpse into the week and what I thought
of the whole experience if you care to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was definitely the closest experience I have had to actually
teaching, or will have at all before deciding for sure if it's what I
want to go into.  I got to run class for two blocks using the powerpoint
that I made yesterday and following Krista's lesson plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I introduced tessellations, the different types, and we did two
activities to reinforce the concepts.  Like always, class started with
two SOL problems, which they copied into their notebooks and I went over
before jumping into the powerpoint.  I attached that in case you want to
look at it.  They wrote the definitions of the two different types into
their notebooks too, and after a few examples, we broke into two groups
and did the hands-on activities.  I ran the tracing blocks into
tessellations activity and Tyler and Valerie did the cutting out and
gluing shapes into tessellations activity in blocks 2 and 4,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that being up in front of the class with them listening was
the highlight of my week, and I was very grateful for the experience to
actually teach, although I think I was still doing Mrs. York a favor so
she could do other things too.  It would have been a lot more work had I
made the lesson plan and decided upon the activities myself too, but
even just making the slides, there is quite a bit of time that goes into
planning class that I never had an appreciation for in the past.  I
definitely think that putting time into planning effective activities
could significantly affect how well the students learn, and their
feelings of math in general, based on how much they enjoy going to
class.  The cut-out shapes were from the VCTM's "illuminations" and it's
great that there is such a resource, without collaboration between
teachers it would be so much work, and I can see why the first years of
teaching are the hardest when still assembling lesson plans and
materials to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am very glad to have taken part in the Noyce Internship
program, and it has definitely helped me to decide what I want to do,
and whether I want to teach math in a high needs school.  The levels of
respect and discipline problems that are associated with high needs
schools are definitely real and affect the ability of all students to
effectively learn, and there were a lot of times that I felt like
students were being force fed math, when they didn't really want to
learn.  It is easy to get frustrated, and talk negatively of the
students like many of the teachers do.  Teaching in that environment is
very draining, and I think it would be hard to do every day.  Given
these obstacles, I'm not sure that I want to teach in a high needs
school, but I haven't really decided anything for sure, I have to think
about it a lot because that's a big decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best parts of the week were interacting directly with students and
helping them to actually learn.  And the most difficult parts were
having to deal with students that don't want to learn, are disruptive,
and are disrespectful.  It's the helping students part that keeps the
teachers coming back every day, and the difficult students that make it
a challenge to do so.  So, for future years, things that I think should
be emphasized are the directs interactions with students, and getting a
chance to stand up in front of the class by one's self.  The things that
I could've done without are the negativism (the teacher's lounge) and
the students being disrespectful, but those are both part of teaching
and of teaching in a high needs school, so I think that they are also
just part of the experience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stop-motion compilation, 1 hour &lt;em&gt;compressed to&lt;/em&gt; 13 seconds!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got around to putting together my first stop-motion video!! Check
it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished 12th or 13th, can't remember exactly, but it wasn't really
where I wanted to be with the effort that I put in...but I think that
changing up my position would have helped tremendously (lowering seat,
titling forward, moving forward to accommodate for more stretched
position in psuedo-aerobars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sunday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should first mention that the directions were wrong, but with Lauren's
GPS and her driving skills we were still able to get there in plenty of
time for my race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was again warm enough for just the jersey and shorts, which was
awesome, and despite starting in the way back, after an aggressive
sprint out (may or may not have been across the yellow haha) and some
aggresive cornering, I was right where I wanted to be.  I sat in for
awhile, we were doing three laps.  Here's a look at the course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_186" align="aligncenter" width="378" caption="A
pretty flat, very scenic
course"]&lt;a href="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wm_course.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wm_course.jpg" title="WM10_course"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty funny during the first lap, a guy from some team that had
three riders went off the front early, and of course nobody really
bothered chasing with so long left, until his teammates sprinted to the
front and both pulled hard to bring him back!! What do these people
think?!?! Haha...chasing down their own teammates.  Actually I just
remember now, I heard one navy guy lecturing another to not chase down
any navy attachers haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon from VCU is pretty cool, and he has a strong guy on his team Sam
that he thought I should try to work together with.  We decided that Sam
and I should attack the second time we come over the start/finish hill,
so about three of four miles from that hill, Sam and I got on the
front.  We pulled all the way to the hill, not too hard, and went up the
first and steepest part of the hill fast but not attacking yet.  Then we
kept the pace up on the flatter section of the hill, and hit it hard up
the last part.  I was on the left, and it was pretty sweet to be out
front attacking going by the crowd! A pretty sweet picture of Sam and I
hitting it out in front of the field is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_187" align="aligncenter" width="450"
caption="Sam and I attacking
hard!"]&lt;a href="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wm_attacking.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wm_attacking.jpg" title="WM10_attacking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack didn't stick, we never really got away, although I do think
we strung the field out.  There were some other strong guys with us up
front, and we all decided to attack again out of the next corner while
people were still tired.  So we all went, there were maybe like 5 or 6
of us in on it, but somehow the remainders of the field stuck on.  So we
were in a group of 30ish, and it was going to be a field sprint I took
it.  We rode out the rest of that lap, and I got in the second row of
riders once the whole road opened up and we were at the bottom of the
hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt fresh, and took off up the hill on the left.  I was going hard up
the steep part, when the guy in front of me went down...and I went right
over him.  From my wounds, I've figured out  that I took the hit with my
left knee and right handlebar, rolling onto my right knee, shoulder, and
elbow.  I was the second to go down, and landed facing the oncoming
riders, and it all went by so fast but I'm pretty sure I got hit by like
5 other riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloody and hurting, I got up and started pushing the bike, but it
wouldn't roll.  So I picked it up and put it on my shoulder only  to
realize I had no skin on that shoulder.  I carried the bike further,
only to notice the smashed handlebars and was so pissed that I crashed,
with Lauren and her dad there, when I had such a good chance to finish
well and felt so strong, that I just threw the bike on the side of the
road and walked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet it was quite a sight to see me walking up the road, with blood
pouring out of every joint.  When I got the bike back, the most amazing
part, besides the handlebars, is the amount of blood on the bike.  Here

&lt;p&gt;Poor bike...anyway yeah I slowly got medical attention as the pain began
to set in, my left knee was pretty deep.  Most painful of all, because
of all of the nerve receptors in our hands, was my finger on which I had
lost most of the skin right on the tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is  that all of injuries are "just flesh wounds" (I'm
thinking Monty Python quote here) and no bones were broken and my head
didn't hit the ground.  In retrospect, I'm also really glad that my
handlebar crushed the way it did, as I think that it absorbed most of
the energy of the impact allowing my frame and fork to remain intact. 
The shifters, aside from their covers, also appear to be fine, which I'm
attributing to them being noticably loose before the race which allowed
them to move before being demolished.  Even the one on the trashed
handlebar side is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it back to Tech just fine, and David had left the light on, door
unlocked, and had a much awaited bed ready for me when I got to his
townhouse.  Minus the crash, would've been a near perfect weekend, but
all in all it's OK, I should be healed up by the time school starts
again!  The bad part is that I was planning on getting in some good 
training in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; weather, but looks like I'll have
to just chill for the week.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>I'm at Lauren's house and ready to race tomorrow!</title><link href="/2010/03/05/im-at-laurens-house-and-ready-to-race-tomorrow/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-05T23:07:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-03-05T23:07:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-05:/2010/03/05/im-at-laurens-house-and-ready-to-race-tomorrow/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The trip today went well, although packing was a little hectic and my

room arrangements for Break got shuffled around, it all worked out!
 Nick Waugh's landlord freaked out...told him it would've been a
violation of the lease and that she would call the cops if we were
there...so I talked to David Henry and Arturo and I are going to crash
on the couch there, no worries!  And I had realized a little last minute
that I wouldn't be able to get back in the dorms Sunday...so we had to
run stuff that I'll need for next week out to my car.  I was going to
have Reid take my bike, and ride it over there, but I got my bike rack
out of my car for Lauren in case she needed it to bring her bike back,
since Rob was planning on coming back from break with her too, and we
put it on the back of her car just for somewhere to put it...and then I
just ended up putting my bike on and we brought it that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wish that tomorrow was the road race, because I'm ready to
race! But, I'll just have to save it for Sunday.  I don't wanna kill
myself in the time trial...winning is pretty anti-climatic in a time
trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren did a good job driving, with my bike and all, and her house is
nice! Her dad had four steaks ready to cook, and just to go along, I
opted out of my Lenten sacrifice for one night.  &lt;a href="http://tweetphoto.com/13337423"&gt;Here's a link to a pic
of the poor bike haha.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I totally killed the paper that I had due Thursday, the &lt;a href="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ld_report_reagan_3_4_10.docx"&gt;ES Literature
Review
Report&lt;/a&gt;! A
summary of the studies of BPA and human health.  On the whole, very
damning, and it's amazing that we still produce 6 pounds of this stuff
for every American every year, it can be found in 92% of our urine and
clearly linked to many problems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test that I had also been stressing about Thursday night went well,
but I don't wanna speak too soon haha! But I'm sure I did fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, as I said in my twitter, I have a day of racing,
going on a recovery ride with Lauren bc the weather should be beautiful,
shopping for clothes for next week, and then watching a movie!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Almost Spring Break!!?</title><link href="/2010/03/04/almost-spring-break/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-04T00:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-03-04T00:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-04:/2010/03/04/almost-spring-break/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's Wed night and that means I've only got one day left before break,

since I don't have any class Friday! I'm really excited for break to get
here, because I need a break for sure, but it's also hard to believe
that I'm already done with half of the semester (7 of 14 weeks down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This break I'll be staying in Blacksburg, and teaching Math at East
Montgomery High School as a Noyce Scholarship Intern! I'm definitely
considering a career in teaching, not sure about high school but who
knows, I think it would be a pretty sweet job. Teach, and run a bike
shop haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week was good, and busy, but is not quite over. Tomorrow I have
stuff due for SynTech, a paper in ES, and have a Mass and Energy
Balances test at 7PM. Right now, I'm procrastinating finishing/preparing
for all of these things haha. I also have a web development meeting for
Newman, but probably won't make that because it's at 6PM before my test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Fri I don't have any class, and will be going to Lauren's house
for the weekend, to race at William and Mary. Works out really well
being the first weekend of spring break both this year and last. The
races are the same as last year, an ITT on Saturday with start times at
10AM (which means I'm probably close to 11) and a road race on Sunday,
and I go off at 11:05AM. Other plans for the weekend include Lauren
showing me stuff around town I'm sure, and going shopping for clothes
for teaching the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today's race was good, and definitely an experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annapolis was sunny at mid 30's, a pretty nice day really, and we were
on the Naval Base (almost didn't get through security haha), with the
same criterium course as last year so I knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the race …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today's race was good, and definitely an experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annapolis was sunny at mid 30's, a pretty nice day really, and we were
on the Naval Base (almost didn't get through security haha), with the
same criterium course as last year so I knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the race started out pretty mild, I got a great start even though I
showed up to the line a little late by sneaking into the front line on
the right side, which is the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; side to be on for that part of the
race.  Here's a map to help explain what I'll be talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_144" align="alignnone" width="450" caption="A
short, challenging
course!"]&lt;a href="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/navy_crit_w.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/navy_crit_w.jpg" title="Navy Crit Course"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah that's the course, and we are going clockwise. (or as we decided
today, regular threaded direction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\&amp;lt;tangent&gt;On another completely unrelated note, have you ever wondered
how large an acre is? well, it's defined to be roughly the area that an
ox can plow in one hour!\&amp;lt;/tangent&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so after about 10 laps of racing, probably 2/3 of our 30 minutes,
Navy had been pulling the whole way.  3-4 guys doing all the work, and
the whole time I was sitting &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; behind them, exactly where I wanted
and needed to be.  Their coach was yelling at them to send one guy off,
and have the other relax on like every lap, and finally I heard one of
them say "next lap." I paid close attention, and sure enough one of them
attacked hard off the front of the race! I got a slightly late jump, but
thought that this break may win the race, so I went for it.  It was at
about the start finish line, which is really fast, and us two were alone
going into the BRUTAL wind coming off the water on the back side. (left
side on the map).  He started about 20meters in front of me, I closed it
to about 10 going into that section, and we both sprinted &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=balls+out"&gt;balls
out&lt;/a&gt; through
that wind.  I had about caught him for the right turn, and then it  goes
into a decent little uphill, and checking behind me it looked the field
was just getting around the corner into the wind! But then, as we
started to hit it up the hill, my legs were just done.  I didn't have
power left, catching him in a dead sprint in the most brutal wind had
completely gassed me.  So much so, that I had to relax and let him
go...if only I had another 10 seconds of effort in me!! The chase group
and field caught me, although the field was only about 15 deep at this
point...and I struggled to hang on to both.  I definitely sprinted too
hard, but I was so close.  I ended up just chillin and trying to
recover, drifting off the back of the field, and frustrated that I had
lost it in the attack. I would feel a little better, rip a harder lap,
and then relax again for the rest of the race...and gave a hard last two
laps to pick off two Navy guys and finish 13th.  I didn't care at all,
or have any idea where, I finished at that point, I had pretty much
failed. I was really pissed at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, I know that I went for it, (the Navy guy that broke won solo),
but just didn't have it today. Lauren told me that I should sprint up
Nellie's Cave (massively steep road in BBurg) hahah, I don't think she
has any idea what road she is talking about though haha it's massive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to meet up with Zach Barbaro, who goes to the USNA but he was
out and wasn't going to back till later that night.  I was suprised that
he had the time off, seeing as he's a freshman at the naval academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid did a video interview of me, and caught me when my frustration was
just beginning to taper down...I was just so close to being 1/2!  The
interview should be up Monday when Ben Rice gets a change to hook up his
camera, and it'll go here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[video coming soon]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day I pretty much just watched some more bike racing, oh
something else I wanted to mention was that in that 180 degree corner,
I'm pretty sure that I was scraping my &lt;em&gt;RIM&lt;/em&gt; on pavement, it was so
steep going into it... Yeah and then we just drove back to Lyndsay's and
ate dinner and pretty much chilled. That's all for day 1, more action to
come tomorrow in the ITT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 2: Individual Time Trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertised as a 17-mile, rolling course, I was pretty excited to do the
TT.  When we got to the school where we parked though, it was snowing
pretty hard.  That was an hour and half before the first people went
off, which meant I had another 53 minutes until my start, which was at
1053 (naval time) haha.  Fortunately, the snow let up, and I warmed up
on the trainer before heading to the start line.  With my aero helmet
on, and my arm pads in place, I was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went hard out, and it felt like I was going pretty far downhill all
the way to the turnaround point, with a strong headwind though, and I
made it to the turnaround point in 20:30, not thinking to check my
mileage too.  Even though it was going to be uphill, I expect close to
the same time on the way back, and at about 35 minutes was about to pick
up the pace to the finish.  The hills on the way back didn't feel bad at
all, I only got out of the saddle twice.  Just to make sure before I hit
it hard and used everything I had to finish, I checked the mileage,
expected only 1.5-2miles for the last 5 minutes, but my mileage read 12
miles, which meant I had 5 miles to go!!  So, instead of hitting it
harder, I relaxed to save effort for the finishing stretch...and about
two miles later I looked up and saw the finish! So I sprinted to the
finish....with a total distance of 14.3 miles on cyclocomputer.  They
had measured the course wrong, and I had slowed down for the last two
miles that I should've been finishing strong on....I was pretty pissed.
How hard is it to measure a course?? And that I had not looked mileage
at the turnaround, or paid attention to landmarks, and didn't go off of
my elapsed time...but it's hard to think so clearly in the middle of a
hard effort I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I finished in 10th place, but with an extra 30 seconds
that I'm SURE I would've had...I would've been 6th!! Oh well...guess I
learned to pay better attention to the landmarks to know where I am on a
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a rant of mine about how they can't measure a TT course haha:
[video coming soon]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't had time to stitch them together, but I also took some
stop-motion pictures which I hope are going to come out really cool.  I
drove the first hour of the way home, before I relieved of duties for
almost hitting Jacob Aber lol and we stopped at Red Robin on the way
home to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a really fun weekend, and although I would've liked
to finish better, wouldn't we all haha?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A solid week and ready for Navy!</title><link href="/2010/02/26/a-solid-week-and-ready-for-navy/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-26T23:54:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-02-26T23:54:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-02-26:/2010/02/26/a-solid-week-and-ready-for-navy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So this is going to be a short post, we're at Lyndsay McKeever's house

&lt;p&gt;-I finished the book Living Downstream, and the ending wasn't super but
it was definitely an interesting read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ben Rice and I solved the worlds energy problems on the ride here, and
decided that I am going to buy and run Hokie Spokes bike shop while I'm
teaching at Tech in a few years.  I also might have convinced Ben to
build a HPV super aero bike for his senior design project to break the

&lt;p&gt;So today Catherine and I hosted a spaghetti dinner to raise money for
our bike and build trips, and it was  a GREAT success! We raised \$418,
and with Kroger's help only spent \$40 on food, so that means \$378 are
going to help build affordable housing! Judging by the amount of money
and number of plates we went through, about 80 people came out, which
was &lt;em&gt;awesome!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;WF Prologue and Road Race&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;Nick did a cool video review of the
weekend:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;[vimeo 9681455]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;The races on Saturday were staged from
a winery, which was pretty sweet, except for the beware of pesticide
signs we parked next to on the vines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;The prologue was painful, I got to
rock my new aero helmet and Reid let me borrow his aero wheels, so I was
for sure feeling fast. I didn't actually get the result until Sunday,
but ended up 14th in the C's with a time of 7:05.  Using Reid's wheels,
I didn't actually know how fast I was going, but using that time and the
distance of the race puts me at 19.74mph, which I'm pretty happy with
considering that the whole course was mostly uphill!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;The road race was good also, the
weather was BEAUTIFUL which makes any race fun.  Brett and I started at
the very back of the pack, which was really pretty terrible, and in the
process of getting a better position I had to lock my rear wheel
probably 3 times, because of all the yoyo-ing the back of the pack was
doing.  Eventually we made up front, with myself taking some sketchy
outside lines on corners across the yellow to pass, but once I was up
there things smoothed out.  There were some hard accelerations and some
minor attacks, which split up the field real good, and so by the time we
were on lap 3/3, there were only about 25 of us left, and I was the only
Tech rider.  I was feeling strong the whole race, which was pretty sweet
because I was just chillin talkin to people, and actually met some guys.
 This dude from Marshall, who I presume is the only member of their
cycling team, had taken a plain white jersey and hand-drawn the marshall
logo and name on the back haha, talked to him for awhile.  Then about
halfway through that last lap, we actually started some pacelining, and
I manned up and took a hard pull, and when I moved to the left...sure
enough no one else pulled through. So I sat there, stopped pedaling hard
(although never stopping pedaling) and as soon as I relaxed the speed, I
heard a really nasty wreck happen in the middle of the field.  My fault?
Maybe...but who knows what happened.  If it was because of the
decelleration, it shoulda been the fault of whoever wasn't pulling
through really.  And so I didn't want to just sit on the front, so I
shifted down and few and sprinted out to the right....and then it was
just me! But I'm pretty sure the field knew as well as I did that I had
no intentions of really attacking haha, because there was no reaction in
the form of chasing me haha. Maybe I could've rode away with it...but
5mi is a really long time to ride by yourself at the end of a race. So I
got back in, and as the end of the race approached I moved into about
third wheel on the left side of the race, hoping to be able to sprint
out left at 200m.  But, when the road opened, the guy in front of me had
the same idea, the problem being that he didn't sprint fast enough! So I
was kinda stuck, kinda too tired to sprint hard anyway, and rode across
in 8th.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;Sunday Criterium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;The highlights of Sunday include:
finishing 5th in the crit, laying the parking lot IN A TSHIRT getting a
sunburn eating ice cream out of a half gallon container...and well
that's pretty much the best.  The crit, like the other races this
weekend, was pretty awesome and I think it may have been because I'm
strong enough this year to do more than just hang on the field...I can
move around and use some strategy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;Less than two weeks of class remain
till spring break, gonna make it till then!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A busy week!</title><link href="/2010/02/18/a-busy-week/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-18T20:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-02-18T20:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-02-18:/2010/02/18/a-busy-week/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So having not done much work over the weekend, on top of two big tests,

this was a hard week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had: an ochem test, syntech (ochem lab) report due, ES paper due, lots
of mass and energy HW due, and a test in calculus of several
variables...as well as meeting the BB PD, reading at mass on Ash
Wednesday, a bunch of meetings, and trying to train for this coming
weekend.  Ok that's enough complaining haha and somehow I managed to
survive!  Well, almost, I still have to do my Mass and Energy HW for
tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, I was suuuper sore from the race Sunday, so I did a light
40min spin on the trainer, and brought out the foam roller.  Man, I
forgot how much that thing hurts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I only have two classes on Mondays, and didn't make it to my 8AM,
I had to finish the HW and go give it to my professor.  Lauren went over
with me before lunch, and got to meet Prof Durrill, cuz he's the man,
and I got my test back too from Friday, 95!! Pretty psyched about that,
although it wasn't really super hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day consisted of class, the cycling meeting, dinner with
Lauren, Dave and Emily, and preparing for the week (i.e. syntech
prelab).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting with Marty from the BB Police was OK, he was for the event, but
told us about all of the obstacles he saw and the problems with it.  We
all still came out of the meeting positive, but upon filling out the
application to make it a town event...the problems began.  Basically it
looks like we'll need \$300,000 of insurance and pay for the police to
have the road closed, AND sign under the line saying "applicant shall
assume risks incident to or in connection with the permitted activity
and shall be solely responsible for damage or injury, of whatever kind
or nature, to person or property, directly or indirectly arising out of
or in connection with the permitted activity..." and there's no way I
can do that.  But, I think we're still going to try to get it by the
Town, and if they're not on board, it's gonna happen anyway! That's the
true spirit of critical mass anyway, since we are asserting that it is
our RIGHT to bike on the road and not a privilege that requires permits
and police. So it's gonna happen, and it's gonna be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied a TON for vector calc Tuesday night, some with Ruthie, and
actually started to make some sense of the long equations and theorems
in my notes. Then at 11, I hopped on the trainer and did 4x5min
intervals, followed by a cold shower, and studied for another hour or
so.  I really enjoyed doing the 5min efforts on the trainer, b/c I'm
actually preparing very specifically for the race this weekend which
starts with a PROLOGUE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again on Wednesdays I only have two classes, and after my 8AM, I worked
hard on vector calc all the way up till the exam at 2:30 except for
lunch with Lauren at 11, and think I did fairly well on the test. I
totally blanked on one formula, that's I soo should've known...but still
think I did ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Ash Wednesday, marking the beginning of Lent, and I chose to give
up red meat.  So far, it's been all meat, and Lauren didn't want me to
"b.c of cycling" but I really don't need that much protien for cycling,
it's a carb-intensive sport! Endurance training is soooo unlike any
other sports (aka normal high school sports).  Reading at Mass went
well, I went over with Kristen and met up with Justin, Jenny, and Hayden
on the way there haha, pretty cool to have friends to sit with at Mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn't really feel too ready with O'Chem, I did the HW over
again that was due Thursday as review, and did two practice tests.  I
also had to work on my ES paper, which was lit review table, and the lab
report for simple distillation, fractional distillation and
refractometry.  It took me till 4AM, but I got it all done, and felt OK
about ochem...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could've started "thursday" a little earlier, since the first four
hours of the day I was still up studying, but the day really started
with my 8AM ochem test.  This is where today started to go wrong: I woke
up feeling pretty refreshed, which immediately worried me, and it looked
a little light outside.  I glanced at the clock: &lt;strong&gt;9:05AM.&lt;/strong&gt;My exam ends
in 10 minutes. Immediately I went into panic mode and threw one some old
clothes, not bothering with gloves or a hat, or socks for that matter,
and sprinted on my bike to Hahn Hall. Got there at 9:15, my lungs
burning from the 25F air, looking like death, and went up to my
professor and told him that I had just woke up... and he said to meet
him at his office.  I had syntech lab now, but that wasn't important. So
I met him, and verified that I hadn't seen the test or anything, and he
set me up in an empty lab to take it.  PHEW!  I don't really wanna say,
but it probably didn't hurt that I still had the ash on my forehead from
the day before, knowing the Prof Kingston is really religious (he told
us the first day that he sometimes preached at a local church).  It was
just me in the lab room, and I had my completed practice tests in my bag
and knew they would've helped, but I didn't open it. Not sure how well I
did on the test, but I think I did OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, on my way from Hahn South to Hahn N where the lab is,
I saw my TA in the staircase! I frantically told him my little story,
and he said no worries, to just go to the lab and he'd be there in a
few, he was getting a sample.  I worked quickly in lab, and by two hours
had finished the whole lab with everyone else, although I was the last
to leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired, looking and smelling like hell from the whole ordeal, I opted to
skip ES lecture for the second time in four semesters, to come back to
the room and shower, and eat.  In that time, I also finished up the
paper and submitted it, before going to discussion.  Discussion was
good, ChE soph seminar was good, learning about the oil refining
industry and it's need for chemical engineers...don't think that's what
I want to do though. But it could be who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I went on a mini shopping trip to CBurg, went and gave James the
\$600 for the deposit and first month of our house, and picked up a
metal file to wage war with some lawyer tabs this weekend! (Lawyer
tabs=those annoying pieces of metal that won't let your front wheel come
off the bike.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also my first real post on the new site!! I think this is gonna
work for me to update this summer and for all the time! Soon hopefully
I'll start spicing things up with pictures, and see how easy that is
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, I'm super excited to be finished with this weekend
and to have a late valentine's dinner with Lauren tomorrow night, and to
race this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>NC State Race Weekend</title><link href="/2010/02/15/nc-state-race-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-15T20:35:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-02-15T20:35:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-02-15:/2010/02/15/nc-state-race-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the whole, it was a successful weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started snowing Friday night, and it wasn't long before the races
were delayed by two hours the next day...and when I got waken up at 8AM,
they were cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still got out for a solid 40 mile ride, going out around NC and
then back into Chapel Hill.  It was a pretty cool city and nice
campus...but still not as nice as tech haha, their Franklin street was
sick though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Race day:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My race was at 4 on Sunday, so I took some pictures of the other riders,
and hung out in the van trying to stay warm.  By the time our race
rolled around though, it had warmed up to the low 40's and sunny!
Definitely the best conditions of the day for the Men's C's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race went well, I used some strategy and didn't let myself get any
further back than 10th, and basically just hung in.  There were some
breaks that I had to chase along with...and before I knew it on the last
lap (4th 7mi lap of 4) we were down to a group of 18 riders.
 Unfortunately, due to some very very poor planning on my part, I hadn't
drank much water all day lounging around, and had only taken half a
bottle with me which I didn't really get a chance to drink.  Guess it
never caught up with me in D's because our races weren't that long, but
with about 3mi to go, I was feeling fine, but my legs started cramping
so bad that I couldn't straighten them! So I basically coasted the last
bit, passing one kid who crashed out hard, and took my 18th place.  Of
54, that's not so bad.  And as I found out, I was the only Tech rider to
actually finish all four laps! We had some pretty elaborate strategy
mapped out too haha...dang.  But I'm sure we'll get it in gear, and
although we had no points to show in Men's C for this race, I'm not too
worried, I felt strong.  I'm going to take it as a lesson to hydrate
before races...and never do that again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent dinner in Chapel Hill at Armadillos with a tasty Fat Tire,
and we were on our way back.  Idk what took so long, but we didn't get
back till 11PM! So I got to see Lauren for an hour of V-day, and we're
going to get dinner on Friday! (since we're driving down Sat morning to
Wake Forest, and I'm pumped!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really can't wait for the prologue this coming weekend, the RR, and the
Crit!  A real weekend, should be a real test.&lt;/p&gt;

well start with the same sentence everytime. I think twitter, which I
have heard called micro-blogging, has taken the place of my this online
journal I call a blog. Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made one for-sure resolution for 2010, and for good hopefully:&lt;br&gt;
-No soda!&lt;br&gt;
It's pretty simple, and I've kept it for 8 days now. Haven't really been
too tempted yet, but the reasons for the resolution are pretty simple:
there's no good reasons TO drink it, and I'm not going to miss the fake
sugar (HFCS). I think I may be a little healthier in the long run, and
since I don't drink coffee, looks like the only way I can get a caffeine
fix is tea now haha, but I don't need that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple day's I've worked really hard and thought a lot about my
Bike and Build trip this coming summer, and with every thought and every
converstaion I am just getting more excited! The big news are:&lt;br&gt;
-I've finished (with help) an awesome flyer:
andyreagan.com/files/flyer.pdf, definitely check it out and I hope to be
hanging it up everywhere!!&lt;br&gt;
-I'm going to have an article in the next issue (Wed, 1/13) of the Eagle
Observer, our local paper! I'll definitely post the link once it is up.&lt;br&gt;
-I've been training! I'm really training for the upcoming racing season,
but it's all the same!&lt;br&gt;
-I've got \$200 raised! A huge thanks to those who have donated! (\$3800
to go!) Upon a review of my personal finances, I plan to be donating
\$1288, the total amount of the \$4000 that would go to support the trip
itself. This way, all of the money that others donate will be directly
to support the affordable housing groups Bike and Build works with,
without paying for me biking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been going very well this break too, I feel like I've actually
been getting a lot of work done for IT at OBG (work that otherwise
wouldn't be done) and been getting a better feel for what it's like to
work there as a Chemical Engineer from talking to the ChemE's there. And
also importantly I have been making money that will be going to pay for
my bike and build trip donation, and books and spending money for this
spring all of my Junior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also spent some time updating my Four-Year-Plan, which is really
just my class schedule for the next two and a half years. The good news:
I'm taking the classes I need to be this spring. Also good news:
Assuming I don't fail anything, I'll have &gt;171 credits and at least two
DEGREES after four years! I may be making some grand assumptions, but
it's really not too unreasonable. Oh man, how easy my schedule would me
if I dropped ChemE and only did Math/Chemistry...now I'm just dreaming
haha I can handle it so I better stick with it. That engineering degree
is going to be able to get me a job if I need it. I'm not sure when I'll
need to start looking more seriously at grad school, aka what I want to
study in grad school and if I really want to go (right now, I do!)...&lt;br&gt;
And oh yeah, the whole plan is accessible at:
andyreagan.com/files/fyp.pdf&lt;br&gt;
I did look into undergraduate research, and getting into honors program
just for the priority class registration, but I just can't do it, too
much...&lt;br&gt;
Other good news I may have forgot to mention, after this spring I will
have finished my math minor if I choose to stop there in Math (6 more
classes for the major, 6 very hard classes, that is) and with only two
additional classes (ES helps) I can pick up a Green Engineering minor.
Sean McGinnis, who is in charge of the whole minor, is one of our ES
teachers and he is awesome. The biggest focus of the minor appears to be
LCA (Life Cycle Analysis), a practical tool for evaluting the impacts of
anything (good, services, choices) which informs decisions that effect
the environment! That reminds me...ES will be coming to end after this
semester, which is quite sad :( ...I'm going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't eaten since work (and had to stare at food while serving lunch
at the Rescue Mission today for two hours) and I smell that my dad's
super-nachos are done, so that's all for now!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well they're not done quite yet haha...so here's some more fun facts
about my life I guess lol:&lt;br&gt;
-I'm really excited to go to SU game tomorrow, should be pretty awesome&lt;br&gt;
-I found a 18-Gallon Rubbermaid in the basement, and quickly filled it
with stuff. That's all I'm going to have to pack in (sleeping bag and
thermarest pad included) for the whole summer...&lt;br&gt;
-Tully's tenders are unbeatable, and I can't eat enough of them&lt;br&gt;
-We almost got Dinosaur's #1-in-the-nation BBQ for lunch today, but
didn't, bummer&lt;br&gt;
-I learned how to throw playing cards at like 80mph, from an article in
men's health...I don't know when or where, but I can't wait to
unexpectedly crank some cards&lt;br&gt;
-Avatar in 3D was excellent, but I still like Fight Club better (just
watched both). I can name all 8 rules, in order. I dare someone to ask.
And I just saw Inglorius Basterds last night, we had it on Blu-Ray and I
was all excited for it on the 1080P projector, had Zdanowski and Anne
over, and was somewhat dissappointed&lt;br&gt;
-This semester in college should just be AWESOME, there are sooooo many
things going on with sustainability and getting ready for B&amp;amp;B and taking
plently of hard classes, the ES action project coming to fruition,
RACING SEASON...I could go on, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bro, your nachos are done"&lt;/p&gt;

throw a quick update up. Its the middle of exam week right now, and it
hasn't really been that hectic. I've been studying rather lightly, since
I already know the physics and can get a B in organic chemistry with a
decent grade on the final. The great news recently is that the physical
chemistry test that I thought that I got a 50 on, I actually got an 80
on! I took the whole time on the test, and alwasy bubble last, and I got
one row off bubbling...and so Madsen gave me half of those points back,
moving me to a 65. We just got our final grades today: class average 66,
I got a 76, and he said there would be "very significant curving"! So
the class that I thought I was doomed with a C in from one bad test...I
might get a B after all!!&lt;br&gt;
Hmm so some other things that I got figured out: I had no idea at all
who I was living with next year, and was getting a little worried as all
of my friends were starting to sign leases, so I gave Dave Henry a call
since I heard a rumor that he was looking for a house, and we're going
to live together next year! So I'm pretty excited about that, finally
having some space. We found one spot that was 3BR for \$600 a month,
right next to campus, but they're looking for someone for spring. That
wouldve been a steal, most people in the apartment complexes are paying
over \$400 each after utilities.&lt;br&gt;
Some other things...I just finished watching Donnie Darko, the plot was
reminescent (spelling) of the Butterfly Effect, with the whole time
travel idea, but I liked it.&lt;br&gt;
And tonight, got some free ice cream at the "Cram Jam" study break, and
participated in a psuedo-flash mob! Hmm and I got the CS3 Suite from my
friend, and have been playing around in flash a lot! I think I might
redesign my whole site in flash, that would be an "over break" project
haha. You can check out one of my first ever flash creations at
http://andyreagan.com/bouncyball.html, the buttons work!&lt;br&gt;

blogspot page into my own, and it's going to make it SO much easier for
me to update!!&lt;br&gt;
Right now, to view any of the old ones, there's a link below this frame
(scroll way way down), and it look like I'm going to be able to actually
move them into blogspot eventually.&lt;br&gt;
So, this is what I'm going to use over the summer most likely,
especially if I can find a way to post video! I'm sure there is.&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, finals week is fast approaching (today is the last day of
class), so I've got to get ready for physical chemistry bigtime. I
bombed the last test..but if I get 100 on the final (completely
impossible in this class) I MAY be able to pull off a B or B-,
hopefully! That's friday morning (look at the calender) and I also have
my ES papers due then as well. The letter to the editor that I wrote
(one of the four ES papers) is the prior post. And then all I've got are
organic chemistry and physics, both Wednesday the 16th. Physics I am not
too worried about, I'm looking at an A in that class if I get an 85 on
the final (a B if I don't take it at all). And O'chem...now looks like
I'm pulling for that B+/A- but I'm going to have to do really well on
the final for either of those. We'll see how it goes, I'm going to study
for pchem now...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, enjoy the new format!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Know your food, people!</title><link href="/2009/12/08/know-your-food-people/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-08T17:19:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-12-08T17:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-12-08:/2009/12/08/know-your-food-people/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a draft of a letter to the editor, as part of our ES final

reflection. Still a definite work in progress, I've been adding and
cutting from it to keep it under 200 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to tell you that you should eat vegan, vegetarian,
flexatarian, or whatever, to "save the environment." All I'm
challenging/proposing is that you take the effort to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt;where
your food comes from, and what your decisions to eat it mean to your
health, our local economy or the industrial agriculture system. As long
as you can be comfortable with whatever that means, then I can have no
problem with you eating a McDonald's cheeseburger for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.&lt;br&gt;
Here's one real example: When thinking about whether to drive or walk
to campus, consider that cheeseburger for breakfast. Looking closely at
the way we grow corn today, it operates on genetically modified corn,
engineered to grow in close quarters, in vast monocultures, and heavily
reliant on tons of fertilizers and pesticides (both fossil fuel based).
Then think about the tractors, the combines, the semis transporting it
and finally, the cow eating it (as today's Holstien cattle are fed
solely grain). It then takes 35 pounds of grain to make one pound of
cow.&lt;br&gt;
You'd literally burn more gas walking than driving your car an
equivalent distance, with red meat as your fuel of choice.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been cycling a lot lately, looking at making a training plan (hence
the calender page) and am even soliciting advice from John Delong, whose
race last Saturday was brutal, and I was amoung the HALF of entrants who
finished. I've been continuing to get more involved with sustainability,
transportation, and bike advocacy (all as one thing really) and my group
for ES is going to plan a community bike ride, I've been speaking with
the Director of Rec Sports, Chris Wise, trying to clear space for the
co-op on campus (whose website I just moved to www.bbc.org.vt.edu this
morning, still accessible at bikeblacksburg.org), I applied for a
Student Entreprenuership (spelling?) Grant of \$1000 for the move of a
co-op to campus. And, along with all of those things, this past weekend
I had a lot of fun as Paul Bunyan during Haloween, which is pretty much
the best holiday ever at college. You can check out Paul in all his
likeness as my profile pic on facebook haha. And on top of all of
things, I have been speding a lot of time with my girlfriend Lauren, and
things are going well :) . (I think we're going on triple date Thursday,
but I'm supposed to keep it on the DL...shhhh) haha. Well it is 2AM now,
and I think Rob is trying to sleep (well either that, or is he is
sleepingup there) so that's all I've got! OH and the new bike that I'm
getting got in Today!! I'm going to go pick up Friday, I'm pumped!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Over a month since my last entry!?!?</title><link href="/2009/10/10/over-a-month-since-my-last-entry/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-10T20:24:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-10-10T20:24:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-10-10:/2009/10/10/over-a-month-since-my-last-entry/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I knew it had been awhile since I wrote on here, but didn't realize it

&lt;p&gt;The coolest two things I have done have gotta be learning to sail, and
riding my bike 140 miles to Polyface Farm (and the visit to Polyface,
check them out
at &lt;a href="http://www.polyfacefarms.com/"&gt;www.polyfacefarms.com!&lt;/a&gt;)! I have some
pictures of Polyface, the ride there, and of Lauren and I that I might
try to put up here soon! I've worked all the home football games...been
keeping up with all of my homework...I made a website for the Blacksburg
Bike Co-op (&lt;a href="http://www.bikeblacksburg.org/"&gt;www.bikeblacksburg.org!&lt;/a&gt;),
and am on the board of the co-op now, which I am taking on as my ESers
in Action project we have to do for Earth Sustainability...applied,
interviewed, and got accepted on the SGA Transportation
Committee...ordered \$22,000 worth of clothing...and well that's about
all I can think of now haha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of classes are done, and they seemed like they went
by pretty fast. Seems to be a recurring statement...time flies. But,
things have been going very well! My schedule was alright, and then I
needed a Mass and Energy class that is a prereq for the next four ChemE
courses, so I dropped some other classes to get into and lonnnng story
made short, I talked to countless people and spent many hours trying to
add the class, and couldn't because it was too full. Despite the fact
that the professor wanted to add me, and there was room for me in the
class both days that I went. Ugh, frustrating. So now I only have 16
credits, and no O'Chem lab...but I have been working with Prof. Durrill
and the Chemistry Dept and I have a plan on paper for me to graduate in
four years, with three degrees. Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have only been back for two and a half weeks, but it didn't take
that long haha and I asked out Lauren, and yeah now we're dating. That's
that lol. It's good so far. She's actually over on the couch now and I
think her and Michelle are talking about my blogging haha. Michelle
wants to know what I'm blogging about, but I'm not going to tell her.
And all of my fans will enjoy this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another long story short, the home MTB (MounTain Bike) race is this
weekend, and David Henry did an awesome job setting it up. I went out
MTB'ing for the first time last Sunday, helped build a dual slalom
course, and did four races today that were AWESOME. We went up this
steep technical uphill, then back down it, and rode a dual slalom (two
identical downhill courses that combine to one) all out at the base of
Old Farm, the gateway trail which is what we TT'ed up and down. And then
I came back and ate and took a nap, and did the short track race. Which
was also awesome! Think I got like 5th haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, back to the game and being "social" haha.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Winning and road race, tully's and making warm bread (not quite toast)</title><link href="/2009/08/30/winning-and-road-race-tullys-and-making-warm-bread-not-quite-toast/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-30T20:20:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-08-30T20:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-08-30:/2009/08/30/winning-and-road-race-tullys-and-making-warm-bread-not-quite-toast/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night I went to the OCC's TNTS race, in hopes of bringing home

really hard and fast and I hung in till the end and beat the olds guys
to the line in sprint. But, since I wasn't 21, I won socks. But hey,
I'll take it!! It only cost \$1 to enter the race...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night Del, Dknick and I went to Tully's after playing
basketball at the park, and the 1/2 off after 9 is a good deal. Sarah
and Lindz both came and met us there eventually and it was fun. I was
just excited that I didn't have to wake up for work the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today, I spent a whole bunch of time hooking up the toaster, and
even more pedaling the freaking thing. I took some video to attempt a
v-blog which, I will put up when I get home. I'm writing this on Del's
MacBook right now haha. Sadly, however I was not able to &lt;em&gt;burn&lt;/em&gt; any
bread although I did get hopeful when I first got to pedaling and
smelled toast, but not that much was really getting toasted...some heat
was definitely produced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first test V-Blog, and is all about my bike
generator/toaster. Using a v-blog may actually save me time, but
uploading this one took literally an hour so idk, that's too long to do
it on the road next summer, which was where I thought it might be the
most useful when I can't type an essay every night.

with my friends for the last few times, drove down with Kyle, and have
spent the past week getting re-acquainted with the college friends! I
also had my first day of classes today and missed one (I didn't go to
Physics recessitation because I assumed that we wouldn't be having it
since we hadn't had the lecture yet, but was wrong...although as it
turns out, my roommate Rob is in the class and I didn't miss anything.)
and I was almost late to another, but it went well. I only had 3 classes
today, the real fun starts
tomorrow. &lt;a href="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/areagan/oldsite/blogs/files/schedule_fall09.pdf"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt;

Del and Dknick and I headed up to Sarah's camp for the night/weekend. I
just love being on the water, so needless to say I loved it. We went
swimming that night, swimming the next day (king of the raft), I
attempted to dive, we went tubing and I went waterskiing, we swam some
more, I read my book, made a bracelet, and we came back later Saturday
night. That pretty much sums it up! Some highlights...I managed to get
Del off the raft at least once in king of the raft, though I couldn't
count the number of times he pushed me off. I think I just started
jumping off myself haha. Tubing we got some major air, both Dan and
Sarah had some unothodox tubing form, but they held on better than I
could haha. The water was a little choppy, and I actually fell on two
ski's a couple times for the first time...and it was fun! I didn't
really get that much book read either, I tried but I think I actually
fell asleep that hammock was just too comfortable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Then the Great Race!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got there early, and Lindz (how I actually spelled her name on the
registration haha) did an awesome job of getting our packets quickly, by
budging the giant line haha. We got Lindz a good position for the Kayak,
kinda snuck it in up front too, but there was room. We got back to the
car with about 20 minutes until race time, and so my Mom went out a
little warm up run and I got on my trainer and started spinning and
getting ready to get that CytoMAX in me. From the car, Lindz and I
watched the runners get started as the gun went off, and about 15
minutes into the race I headed over to the changeover zone, extracting
every last minute of warming up. A little under 24 minutes, I saw my mom
coming and got the wristband from her and took off. I rode as hard as I
could, never leaving the big ring in the whole race, on the gradual
uphill out I held 15-17MPH and was passing crowds of cyclists. I kept in
the aerobars pretty much that whole time too, and sipped on the
remaining CytoMAX in my bottle. All the way out, I was breathing really
hard as I passed everyone, and didn't think I could go any faster if I
tried. One dude passed me on the way out, on a full aero bike, and I
tried to grab his wheel but it was uphill and made little difference. He
was cruisin. Like I was blowin by tons of people, and he pretty much
blew by me. Having ridden the course the week prior did help in the
downhill, I knew what was coming, and didn't touch my brakes. I kept
crushing, and crushing, and crushing along haha and finally made it to
the two steep uphills and sprinted up those. I love the sound of carbon
wheels going side to side like that, the zing-zing... Anyway I knew
there was two-mile, tailwind, gradual downhill to the finish and I had
somehow caught some other fast riders that we going the same speed I
was, and we pacelined into the last 1/2 mile, and then I took off to
beat all them to the finish :-P which I did. My dad snapped one pic of
me coming in, I'll have to see if I can get up here. I handed off to
Lindz, and that was that. My legs were DEAD, and I rode with those other
guys that I had come in with for a 2ish mile cool down and came back to
the car where my Mom and Dad were waiting. I got changed, and we headed
down to watch Lindz finish. We ran into Knickerbocker, which was good,
and spotted Lindz as she crossed the line, and we all took the Kayak
back to the car. Like every year, Lindz had to hit up the milk place,
and the whole chocolate milk tastes like milkshake and was really good.
Of course Dan tried a sample of Monster, even though he was pretty
convinced that he wasn't going to... And we got our food and hung out
until they started putting the teams in order. Once they did, we found
out that we got 7th in our age category...so that was let down for us I
think, having won every year we've competed for the last four years, but
hey it was fun. There were 28 teams in our age category too... The waves
were really rough and I think they got the best of Lindz, and she said
she was on little sleep from working late the night before...I got to go
to bed at 10 haha. Here is what I have for results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;And low and behold, a Bike Generator!!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, with the help of mostly Bill Coon, also his
friend Michael, my brother Kyle, Paco wagner, and my Mom, I have made
massive progress on the toaster! Sunday at Wagner's whapatoola party, I
got talking to Bill Coon and got him to go on a mission with me to get
the generator hooked up. It was like 8:20 by the time we got to Home
Depot, which was closed, along with every other freaking hardware place
in the 315 ...but it was late Sunday night haha. An unsuccessful trip to
get parts to hook up the bike (looking for a pulley or anything really
with a 5/8" keyed shaft) but we got to test out the motor in his barn.
We hooked up the Fluke multimeter, a really really nice multimeter, and
spinning the big Baldor motor with a 990RPM drill got about 45-50 Volts
DC out of the motor, exactly what we had expected. He also had some
inverters lying around, which would have made it much easier to hook up
a toaster to, but the inverters need a 12V input...so we actually
dismantled a winch he had upstairs, which was rated for 12V, and did
some (actually a shit load) of math to figure out that it was a 271 watt
motor, and spinning it definitely generated current so it was permanent
magnet, but before we acutally got a sprocket onto it, it was already
10PM and we had to call it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Monday, I called Nightingales after work and they actually had a 5/8"
bore pulley, so Paco drove me down and I picked that guy up. I called
Bill and left a message, and I was on my way taking my bike and trainer
down to his garage to get them down there when he called me back, and
basically he couldn't weld to that pulley, since it was die-cast, but he
had went to Tractor Supply in East Syracuse during his lunch hour, and
they carried a steel hub with the right bore, but didn't have any in
stock, so he had them call Auburn where they had one, and put that on
hold. So I got my brother to keep me company and we drove out to Auburn
and picked up that steel hub, returning the one from Nightingales on the
way. I dropped Kyle off at our house, and headed straight down to Bill's
with that hub, and then Bill and I drove over to his friend Michael's
machine shop in his garage, where he had a lathe so we could take that
steel hub down to the right size. There were more tools there than I
think I have ever seen, pretty crazy. Shaving down the hub wasn't bad
(easy for me to say, Bill had to change the head or whatever on the
lathe and actually do the work haha). Then we (Bill) spot welded the
sprocket right on, the lathe and the digital ruler they used were good
down to the thousandths of an inch. After letting it cool we took it
back to Bill's garage and got to work hooking it up. The hub with
sprocket slid perfectly onto the shaft of the motor which was sweet, and
Bill threw together a wooden frame to hold the motor while I hooked up
the bike to the trainer and with the extra chain coming off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed onto his old road bike, and started pedaling away. There was a
light bulb and his multimeter hooked up. As I shifted into this big
ring, I saw that light begin to glow, and I kept spinning, and spinning,
until my legs could go no faster. The light bulb kept getting brighter,
and by the time that I hit 70V and my legs could physically go no
faster, that light was shining bright! Powered by my pedaling! Success!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Long time, no blog</title><link href="/2009/08/06/long-time-no-blog/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-06T20:19:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-08-06T20:19:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-08-06:/2009/08/06/long-time-no-blog/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well I never did get a chance to finish that update from July 30 or

playing bball and volleyball at night, and working during the day, and
chilling with del and dknick and zdan and sarah and lindz on the
weekends! Last Friday after work another intern from work, Jill, had a
party at her house for all the interns too and that was fun, but by the
end the only interns (and ppl me and Emma knew) we Emma, Jill, and
myself haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some random Blogspot blog, not sure how I came across it or anything,
there was a pretty cool cascading menu for accessing old blogs, and I
was going to try to put in on here until Emma confirmed that they did it
not with just HTML, but it was part of their CSS...dang. Well I still
don't think that should stop me but yeah hopefully soon there is a new
format to come. You'll just see the most recent blog, and all the others
will be in a menu! But I also think that would require me to have a
seperate page for each eventually...but I don't think that would be that
bad either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bike Toaster, so close!!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I was delivering a printer at OBG Fayetteville, the
manufacturing facility, I was looking around walking through the
warehouse and I happened to notice some old motors on a shelf collecting
dust...so after making a few more passes by delivering stuff, I decided
to check them out. There were probably like 10, and they looked just
like what those old DC motors on Ebay look like so I grabbed one and
wanted to like walk off with it lol but that was a bad idea, so I lugged
the 44 pound motor around and found someone who knew what it was for,
and I told them all about my toaster project and they said that they
were phasing out Dc motors anyway really, and that I could have it!!
Only problem was that the 1/2HP one that I had was AC (all that
techincal writing on the side of the motor that looks like gibberish
actually means something apparently) and so we looked at what else there
and found a DC motor, only problem was that it was 1.0HP...but hey I'll
give it a try I figured! So I lugged the thing out to my car (actually
my Mom's car, mine was in the shop Tuesday so she let me drive hers). I
was pretty pumped, and when I got home I spent all night trying to get
the thing running...but I could never really manage a way to hook up the
5/8 inch keyed shaft to my bike unfortunately, nor could I do it last
night, but I figured how I'm gonna do it and all I got is one piece
missing. I had to go down to Bill Coon's and sign out some of his bike
tools in the process and a bunch of other stuff. Basically all I need to
do now is get the 12T cog from an old cassette onto that 5/8" shaft and
I'll start cranking out some juice hopefully!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requiem for a Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First that's the name of a movie haha, and it was ...interesting, enough
to be worth mentioning (and watching). I forget which night it was, but
it was late and Kyle had downloaded this movie and it was IMDB #65 all
time so we decided to watch it, and I think they should show this movie
in health class! The movie itself was pretty like trippy, the way it was
filmed kinda messed with your head, and basically I never ever want to

&lt;h4&gt;My Birthday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be fair to say that I got to celebrate my birthday THREE times!
Which was awesome. First, Friday at work Jill had baked me a cake, and
everybody signed a card, and Emma sang me Happy Birthday! The cake was
delicious and the card was really nice, so thanks guys!! Birthday #2
was that night with the regular crew (minus Del and Sarah). Right after
I got out of work, me and Slade and Shields went and fufilled what had
been lots of just talk, and jumped off a bridge and into Seneca River.
Facebook is full of picuters, I'll put a one up here too sometime. Us
three met Zdanowski, Hannah, Knickerbocker, and Lindsey for dinner at
Tullys, where I ate &gt;17 tenders and still had to buy cigars. Ya see, I
ordered 15, like always, but it did look like a lot this time and
everyone for some reason thought that I could never eat that much. And
as I struggled to eat the last 5, I didn't think I would either. Which
was odd, since I always order and eat 15. Since it had become a
challenge, I tried my best to eat all 15, and the deal was that if I
couldn't, I would buy everyone cigars. And I just couldn't bring myself
to eat that last tender, the sundae couldn't have helped...but anyway I
bought everyone cigars for the ensuing bonfire at my house, and it
really about worked out bc they paid for my dinner. It wasn't until at
the bonfire that Zdanowski confessed to adding many tenders to my plate,
and that I actually ate like 17 or 18!! Jeez... the bonfire was really
fun...many games of never have I ever took place, and the nice cigar
that Dan and Lindz got me for my birthday was good...and I slept in till
like 10 the next day, which was great.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Domain How-To</title><link href="/2009/07/22/domain-how-to/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-22T17:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-07-22T17:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-07-22:/2009/07/22/domain-how-to/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;This will be my all-in-one how-to get your own domain name, and set it up with a webpage and email.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I never really got time to finish this to the degree that I would
like...so maybe I will someday (July 30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this imformation is available elsewhere...where I once upon a
time read it, but I hope this puts it all in one place. Looking back at
where I got all of this information...pretty much all of it is
on &lt;a href="http://aboutdebian.com/"&gt;aboutdebian.com&lt;/a&gt;, just ignore the linux
parts...although it gets pretty in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you'll need need:&lt;br&gt;
1. \$10, which works out to 2.73 cents per day....worth it!!&lt;br&gt;
2. Brain&lt;br&gt;
3. Free Space (most ISP's and colleges give you about 30MB of space)&lt;br&gt;
4. Content (a blog...resume...something worthy of sharing)&lt;br&gt;
5. Time (a few hours...not a whole lot of time, really)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to have:&lt;br&gt;
1. More time, to do fun stuff with your site&lt;br&gt;
2. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, because it's super easy to include
on your page&lt;br&gt;
3. &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/"&gt;Dreamweaver&lt;/a&gt; (a program
from Adobe to create the web pages) or other web-page generating
software (MS Frontpage...). Notepad works though.&lt;br&gt;
4. &lt;a href="http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/models/r8.html"&gt;Audi R8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5. Advanced knowledge of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol"&gt;IP
Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some basics of the internet. I'll keep it really really simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll use the example of andyreagan.com. The journey begins when you
open your web browser (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome...), and type andyreagan.com in. Maybe this is a bad example, so
we'll pretend that my site is hosted on a dedicated server. Your browser
can't really do anything with that name, so what it does is contacts a
DNS, domain name server, to resolve that hostname to an IP address, with
which your computer can contact the server hosting my site. This is one
of the reasons that internet explorer sucks, bc when you hit "go" it
just says opening page the whole time, it doesn't tell you what's it's
really doing, Firefox and Chrome both give you better information. And
that imformation may be useful in troubleshooting your site, it doesn't
interperet my images correctly, so just don't use IE... Where was I....
Oh so your computer now has the IP address of the site it would like to
contact. It will also need the MAC (a unique physical address) of that
server, so it'll send a request to get that, and the server will reply
with that information. Then, finally, your computer will send a "get"
request to the server of which it knows the IP and MAC address, and that
server will respond with a directory, and your browser will know to open
the file named "index.html". And there you have it. The process is
really the same for email too, but yeah different. It's not really that
important that you understand all of this, either...just know that there
is a DNS server and that it has a purpose of resolving hostnames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Registering Your Domain Name&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a site like &lt;a href="http://www.godaddy.com/"&gt;godaddy.com&lt;/a&gt;, the one with
the super bowl ads, or the one which I would
recommend &lt;a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/"&gt;networksolutions.com&lt;/a&gt; you
can find an avaible domain name (i.e. yourname.net or yourname.com or
many others) and register that name for around (or less than) \$10. For
convenience, you may want to go two or more years out...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.easydns.com/"&gt;EasyDNS.com&lt;/a&gt; is a much better all-in-one
solution than either of those sites above, but it is also more
expensive. If you would be willing to pony up \$40/year, coming to
almost 11 cents per day, this would be a muuuch better way to go. Still
not the cheapest it could've been done, but DEFINITELY the easiest. The
service that this includes for a cost is custom DNS hosting, which we
could be getting for free, but yeah this would keep everything in one
place...I think I might even make the switch next year when my
registration runs out. I don't know why I really need to...but it would
be nice to have everything in one place. And I was just poking around
their site about their stealth website redirection and it was super
helpful, I think I even learned some stuff. I'm going to link to them
later on that, they explain it so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Changing your registered nameservers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give us more flexibility with our Zone File, the file that is stored
on a (well, at minimum 2) DNS servers, we will change our nameservers
over to zoneedit.com's. If you did go with EasyDNS, then you can totally
skip this step, although it's simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At zoneedit.com, we will be both be able to use a "cloaked web forward"
to point yourname.com to the free hosting, and to use GMail for Domains
for all email needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setting up Email&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look under links at the bottom for GMail for Domains. Open that guy up,
and read it. What you'll need to do is open a Google Apps account. I
don't remember the process exactly, but I do remember that it required
that I verify ownership of the domain...there were three choices, and as
long as it is still one, you're going to want to use a CNAME record to
do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the account at Google, don't worry about getting that
warning about getting it verified right away, we'll take care of that
next. Just keep the CNAME that they wanted you to include. And now dig
around until you find the nameservers that Google needs you to put in
your MX record. Copying and saving both those MX entries and the CNAME
entry into a text document, we're ready to go to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Configuring Zone File&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be by far the most technical part, and is definitely
the part that I think I struggled with the most. It comes down to
understanding what a zone record is (which I may have referred to as a
zone file, same thing) and what is in it. All it does is resolve your
hostname to an IP address, but in our case we're not actually going to
be putting in any IP addresses. The types of records we'll deal with are
A, MX and CNAME. A's are the standard hostname resolution....bad
explanation but they'll deal with andyreagan.com and www.andyreagan.com
and m.andyreagan.com to point the web address to some server. The MX
records are mail exchange records, and we'll point them to Google's mail
servers. The CNAME record is the fanciest of them all (there are others)
and it is simply an alias. By alias I mean that it can make
something.andyreagan.com point to google.com or to
somethingelse.andyreagan.com...it's not actually pointing at a server
but is rather an "alias". So, go ahead and drop in the MX and CNAME
records from the text file from Google. Now, since we won't really be
entering "A" records in a traditional sense, we will set up a webforward
to where our site is hosted. This is pretty slick really. What
zoneedit.com will do is actually point the A record to their own server,
on which is a file that simple contains a frame with no border of the
address to which you are web forwarding. As opposed to redirecting, this
will keep andyreagan.com in the address bar instead of the true location
of the
files, &lt;a href="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/areagan"&gt;filebox.vt.edu/users/areagan&lt;/a&gt;
(try it, that'll show the real site in the address bar). For an
additional and perhaps clearer explanation of this service, I'll leave
you to the guys at EasyDNS.com for
their &lt;a href="http://easytest.com/%22"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt;, on this page they're using what
they call stealth redirection (the same thing as a cloaked webfoward) to
make it appear as though you are looking at easytest.com when in reality
you are still on EasyDNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creating the Webpage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part will be pretty skimpy, since I'm not really an expert and this
is stuff that is really easy to look up/play around with. You can't
screw it up... There are professions that deal with just this part, and
those people are called "web designers". The easiest thing to do if
you're a small business needing a web presence is to hire one of these
groups, and they'll make the page sweet, I mean it's what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have Dreamweaver, or are familiar with torrents and can get it,
this will be easy to make a great looking page. It's what the pros use.
Just go to justdreamweaver.com and download a sweet free template,
change the names and content of the pages...and you're set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're working with any other software for creating webpages, I'm no
help, so just have at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're stuck with notepad, don't panic quite yet. HTML is really easy
to write, and with the understanding of tables, you can do pretty much
anything. All sites used to be written in straight HTML with extensive
use of tables at some point....I think. Well, to start, you may want to
look at W3 Schools or right click on any webpage and click "view
source". OK, I just found a page on W3 with examples of everything that
you would ever want to
do. &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_examples.asp"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; should
actually be all you need. Just move down the page one example at a time
and you'll end up with frames, tables, and forms. You may want to skip
ahead and read images really quickly. It's all just learning the syntax
of the tags...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Links, links, links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ride for the Rescue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Sunday July 19th, was the Ride for the Rescue and despite
getting a flat tire I had a great time. It was tough getting up and
ready to ride on three or four hours of sleep, probably the lesser
considering the couch in Zdanowski's basement was not the most
comfortable thing to sleep on, especially trying to share it haha. The
ride itself was great, I was the first person through the first water
stop at 15 miles, having started near the back and worked hard to bridge
up to the leaders, which became me and 3 others. But, when we were going
down from Bennet's Corners toward Shaneateles, I hit a thumb sized rock
on the shoulder with my front wheel and after hearing the huge bang
sound it made on the carbon rim, was thinking "Phew, that was scary" up
until 100 meters futhur when it became apparent that my front tire was
losing air. So, I flatted, and the others rode on...I told them I was
fine because I had a tube, pump, and tire levers with me, everything
that I needed to change a tire. I wasn't truly excited, but hey it was a
good chance to make use of all these gadgets I had bought for this
purpose. Problem was, when I went to put my new tube on...the stem was
way too short for my deep dish carbon front wheel. And the part that got
me the most was that I had my regular front wheel on earlier in the
morning, and decided to use the aero wheel last minute... So I waited
(some time...we must have been pretty far out) for someone to have a
tube I could use or something, and I talked to just about every person
doing the 62 mile ride asking for a long stem tube. A few people had
them that came by in about 20 minutes, but even the "long" stem tubes
weren't long enough!! So I waited some more, was about to call my Dad
until I realized that my phone was out of batteries...sweet. I
considered asking my dad to drive up to the inner harbour and get my
other wheel and bring it to me...since I was pretty sure that I wasn't
going to be able to change the tube. Finally, someone came by on some
Ritchey carbon wheels, and had a super long stem tube with him! I traded
him for the "long" stem that I had acquired...and in another 10 minutes
I had my wheel pumped up to about 80 PSI (pretty soft, really) and was
on my way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That whole ordeal had to have taken an hour, and I was pretty sure that
I was the LAST person out on the route. The first person I caught was
the guy who spoke before we all left who had been on the streets and the
Rescue Mission had enabled him to get his feet under him and get his
life back together. I talked to him for a few minutes, then continued on
my way. I met up with some people riding mountain bikes helping
eachother up the hills (literally, with an outstretched hand on the
other's back) and got to the second waterstop at Skaneatles with a
pretty big group of people. I actually stopped at this one, since I
wasn't really in a hurry any more, and topped off my bottles with
Gatorade. The people running the stop were really nice too. So I
continued to catch people...and worked really hard to catch one group
that seemed to be going fast enough, seeing as how hard it was to catch
them. In that group was the guy with the Ritchey wheels whose tube I was
using, he had said that I would probably catch him haha. I never really
caught names, but this was the group that I rode to the finish with. It
was me and three others, one of whom I realized was Del's Uncle, who I'm
guessing is Mr. Scheutzow, since he is Emily's Dad. We talked pretty
much the whole way back, it was pretty cool. The view across Otisco Lake
was awesome, the sun was out when we got there, and you can see all the
back across the lake. I made sure to point out the Crysler mansion when
we passed it, and since Mr. Schuetzow had been talking about it, I
picked up the pace a few notches after we crossed rt. 20 all the way to
the park. Only problem was that I lost all the people I had riding with
except him instantly and he only held onto my wheel for a minute, so I
got to the park by myself haha, it was a "good crank" as he put it. The
Marcellus HS baseball team were the ones manning the water station, so I
ended up talking to Jon Quick for a while and it was when Mr. Schuetzow
asked those guys if they knew a Ryan Delsomething that I was like hey
yeah he was my best friend in HS, we graduated together, and I told him
that I knew Emily too, and he confessed to being her father haha. And
another one of the guys we were riding with asked them if they knew
...shit I can't remember her last name right now... Emily something and
it was like yeah I graduated with her too! Small world this is....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I performed my best impression of Mark Cavendish to the finishline to
leave the other three that we were still riding with in the dust haha, I
was still feeling pretty fresh really... I saw Jeanne and others from
work, and the people that we worked with at the RM on Friday after I got
there, and had to explain to them why it took me so long haha. I also
caught up with Rich from the OCC club who I had started the ride with,
dropped when I bridged to leaders, and he said that he eventually caught
up to the leaders and finished with them. I shoulda been there! But then
I wouldn't have met Mr. Schuetzow...so everything works out. I saw one
more Marcellian serving food there, never knew her name but she was the
girl that was my height (not really but close) as a freshman on the
girls bball team, she knew my name. And they had blooming onions from
Outback and bottled Orange Crush soda...so good. Mr. Schuetzow took my
number and said that he'll get me on an email list for some rides on the
weekends with those guys, which should be cool. All in all, I think that
with the money I raised that even though it may not be the \$2000 that
was the most someone raised, I think that the Rescue Mission really is
doing a good thing and that by doing what I can, I really did help to
make a difference in the lives of others. If 63 miles sounds daunting,
there are many shorter rides and I would definitely recommend joining
the Ride for the Rescue next year for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to sleep in until I was no longer tired which was a marvelous
start. And as promised, I went on a bike ride with Kaity at 2. I rode
down to her house and we went 14.5 miles out and back on Pleasant
Valley, and she did really well. I had to grab my brakes downhill
sometimes, but it was good. We stopped at Eric and I's favorite rest
spot, by the stream that follows the 13 curves where it crosses Pleasant
Valley. I also found out that Kaity had a twitter so now I have some
friends, woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pretty much chilled until the night, and Del got back late and had
chores to do, so I did him a solid and picked up the cake and ballon's
for Sarah's birthday party at Dan's. I knew Dan was having ppl over, but
I didn't know it was for Sarah's birthday (which was the day prior)
until Del called and asked me to pick stuff up! Dan was freaking out a
little bit about having too many people, so he told me that we didn't
have room for shields and so Eric made other plans before he realized
that we did have room, which was a bummer. And so when we got there, it
was just Me Dknick Del Sarah Zdan Hannah and Johnny Mars. Seven people
isn't really a party, so we called some more and I ended up driving down
and picking up Shannon, who I'm pretty sure had fun too haha. So yeah it
turned out to be fun, Del ended up going to get the funnel, or more
accurately I drove him home to get the funnel lol, and of course I had
to do one after we got it but I don't think that was really gonna have
much effect on anything. Not sleeping couldn't have helped, but I had a
good night's sleep the night before...anyway it ended up being a lot of
fun. Knickerbocker was soooo funny, he fit more of Zdan's pantry into
his pants than I would've ever imagined possible, I'm laughing right now
just thinking about it (lol!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The week (condensed) - Slade's Camp slash my Day Off and working with the RM Friday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting 6 hours of sleep per night (which I guess is my fault...) and
just looking at a computer screen for so many hours a day for so many
weeks was realllly starting to add up. I had thought about taking this
whole week off...but obv didn't. So when Slade invited me to come to his
camp for a night, I told him I couldn't leave that very night haha I had
to go to work at least the next day, but I asked Dave for the day off on
Thursday and worked hard Wednesday to finish all my work and got out
early. Slade drove me and Knickerbocker up in his van and Jack drove up
later with Tyler, Nicky, and Gretchen. I got to swim a couple times and
even though the water was a little cold, it felt really good. The night
was a great time, some very interesting games of kings, the interesting
part being the rules that Slade came up with... I actually slept really
well, Jack and Tyler and Gretchen left early in the morning cuz Jack had
to work or something like that. Slade took the rest of us to Sackett's
Harbor, to get the "best french toast in the world!!" as he put it haha.
It was at the &lt;a href="http://www.tinpangalley.com/"&gt;Tin Pan Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, which was
a really cool restaurant. We sat outside and it was just beautiful out.
The stuffed french toast was soo good, but like he said, difficult to
finish! There was just so much butter and cream haha, if I was to go
again I think I would try to Blueberry Bread French Toast, I saw someone
with one of those and it looked delic., or the cheesecake waffle...it
all sounded and looked so good haha. Not cheap, but worth it. Then we
wandered around the town, I definitely felt like I was on vacation aka
like a tourist lol. We wandered up to the park and after trying to do a
frontflip and almost breaking my back...we found some people who were
dressed up like 1812 times, and they were cooking in a Dutch Oven. We
went over and talked to them, and realized that they were like our age
and that was their summer job, and there are like kids camps going on at
the park and that's what they were doing. The dude had a real 1812 rifle
and was going to shoot it, but he was out of black powder...but we got
to hold it and it was pretty sweet lol. Nicky took a picture on her
phone that is on Fbook, but I can't get to that to put it up here right
now, I probably will if I have time. On our way back to the car we got
some home made ice cream which was really good and then we drove home.
We got home by like 3, I tried my very best to talk Slade into doing our
bridge jumping on the way home but he had class at 5..lame. It was so
nice out that I was definitely going for a bike ride, and Shields asked
me if I wanted to go on a ride and so it was like old times! He hooked
up his speaker to his bike and everything...there were a few differences
from a few summers ago tho. First, it was him that was just trying to
keep up most of the time, and he was the only one of the two of us that
was wearing basketball shorts haha. It's been a really long time since
I've done that haha. We went close to 20 miles, I did 25 including the
to and from my house, which was really good for Eric having not left the
couch in like a year. I didn't really break a sweat until my way home,
but that's ok with me really. All in all, the day and a half off were
really relaxing and just what I had thought that I needed. It was almost
like having more than that off, since I did "work" Friday but it did not
involve looking at any computer screens...all of the interns and some HR
people, like last summer, spent a whole day at the &lt;a href="http://www.rmsyr.org/Home/Main_Page.htm"&gt;Rescue
Mission&lt;/a&gt; in Syracuse. We helped
this time mostly set up for the Ride for the Rescue, which was really
cool since I was doing it. So I got a sneak preview of part of the
course (not sneak really, the routes were posted online) putting up mile
markers for the 10-mile course and of the main area setting up the big
sign, loading and unloading all the stuff that they had to take over
there from the main campus in Syracuse. The two people from the RM who
we worked with were super energetic and awesome, I saw both of them
Sunday and they were excited to see the "OBG Boy doing the 62 miles!"
Haha so that was really good, and Friday night I pretty much just went
to bed early, did an easy-ish ride on my trainer as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sunday the 12th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up early enough to look at the OCC ride which was leaving from
Onondaga Middle School, which is just 7 miles down the turnpike so I
headed out to that. There were 37 and 63 mile options, and I went there
planning on doing 37...ended up doing 63 haha. I hadn't biked since the
Sunday prior so I was definitely hurtin at parts, pretty early in the
ride we did a big climb up Fox road...which was yet another reminder to
my legs that running and basketball and swimming don't mix well with
cycling, especially when they keep me off the bike entirely... Which is
why I lost the lead group, not a big deal though, I rode with this one
other guy. Damn I wish I was better with names... anyway it was pretty
uneventful minus the fact that we took a wrong turn (or, didn't take a
turn more accurately) and went right through the Onondage Nation (the
indian reserve). I didn't really think that was big deal either, but
after we finished, Wayne who had waited for us told us about this one
time that some club riders got shot out in there... There's more to it
than though, not like they were just riding through. Apparently some
asshole flew by them super fast and honked so they gave him the driving
finger, and then mistakenly told that same driver that some f***in
asshole almost hit them back there, and it was the same guy...he
might've just shot in the air, but they heard a gunshot and didn't look
back. But the guy that I rode with told a story about how when he played
lacrosse for West Genny (probably a really long time ago) he used to go
in there on his bike to get stuff for his lacrosse stick, and once when
the tensions were real high went in went through a roadblock that they
were having and they let him in...different experiences for sure. Well
it's been over a week since last Sunday so I forget what I did the rest
of the day but it probably involved a nap, those long rides really tend
to wipe me out!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Lots of Stuff!

&lt;h4&gt;Triathlon &amp;amp; BBall &amp;amp; VBall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I've swam a total of three times these past two weeks, which I
guess is a pretty good start. The first two times I did a warm-up, a
bunch of drills, and a cool-down. Today, I swam 8x50m and I think that I
can definitely feel an improvement from the first day. Making a 50
without being out of breath or completing a 100m will be the next
accomplishment haha. I haven't really biked or ran, since biking four
days straight last Thursday-Sunday...but I have been counting basketball
as my aerobic workout. The 3v3 league got underway Thursday, and with
Big Del, John Ellis, and Mike Rabe we went 3-1. We really shouldv'e won
that fourth game too, losing to Caster and Rudy 15-13 in a game we never
should have lost...I haven't been playing that well but I think it
might've been because of how tired I have been. Tuesday, Bonesaw faced
the fiercest competition to date, but REMAINED UNDEFEATED with only 5
players! The team we beat in the winner's bracket final in a close game
came back through the loser's bracket to force a tough 30-28 battle,
which we got out of after facing three game-points. It was really
intense, definitely the most challenging and intense games so
far...Lauren F and her D1 college vball friend were supposed to come,
but they went to the movies instead...wth lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thoughts on government&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to put this up for so long, I'm going to at least get
something down, even though it won't be "complete"...it'll never be
complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly: I definitely consider myself a conversative, through and
through, and this is based in a firm belief of individualism and the
American Way. And please do not confuse traditional conservative views
with the "conservative" (i.e. centrist) Republican Party. Now "American
Way" sounds corny, but I think that the most that you can ever offer
someone is opportunity. In most cases, this is education, and education
solves all sorts of problems...ranging from poverty, population control,
and sustainability. The latter two are actually quite intertwined too...
And call it being selfish it you will but read on before jumping to
conclusions please, cuz I don't think that is right when government
taxes consume nearly half of an individual's income, and here are just a
few of the reasons: the graduated income tax system we deal with creates
DISINCENTIVE to make more money and work harder, encourages debt as a
WAY OF LIFE, and requires the federal government make decisions that
should be the right of individuals to make. I also believe that in many
ways, those opportunities are completely available today. Here's some
stats that I would love to elaborate on, but I'll let you do the
thinking: As of 2002, the American Federal Government paid \$0.49 of
every dollar spent on healthcare...think about that when Obama talks
about "Nation Healthcare..." it pretty much already is. And the lower
half of the household income bracket pays 1% of the national income
taxes. That means 50% of the nation is paying only 1%....c'mon now
people, how could that possibly be fair? FYI, the median household
income in the US when I read that article (a year or two ago in AP Gov)
was \$44,000... well not that quick, but it's a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ah, that's why they call it a "crackberry..."&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically I'm running out of time...but I've been playing around with
my phone and downloading apps and it is pretty sweet. It's addicting,
like crack, hence the name
lol.&lt;a href="http://www.crackberry.com/"&gt;Crackberry.com&lt;/a&gt; has some good forums
and has a mobile site for downloading applications. There are some
pretty cool ones, like a flashlight app and unit converter and stuff...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Syracuse Rescue Mission&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've served at the RM a few times before, and last summer with OBG I put
in a whole day doing physical labor at the B'Ville Thrifty Shopper where
we pulled up carpet and had to scrape the glue off the floor... So
anyway, today I served lunch at the RM with OBG, it was me and three
other interns and Jeanne Korchak. She said they OBG volunteers the
second Friday of every month, and she is pretty involved apparently.
TOday consisted of washing dishes for a few hours really haha. And next
Friday, like last summer, all of the interns in Syracuse from OBG are
going to spend a day working with the RM. Everyone said that Jeff
(finance intern, back this summer too) and Jim (HR guy) and I got the
short straw scraping floors, but really I didn't mind the one day of
labor. That said, I couldn't do it five days a week, poor Del haha...
And the following Saturday, the one a week from tomorrow, I'm goin to be
participating in the "Ride for the Rescue." It's the RM's biggest
fundraiser, and I heard about from a pamplet that was at OBG. I wanted
to do it last summer, I just never got around to it I guess. So I
contacted some people and found OBG had a team in it, and decided to do
the 62-mile metric century ride, actually the ride that OBG is
sponsoring. They also have 2, 10, 20, and 40 miles rides too. The goal
is to raise \$100 for each rider, and I already put \$20 in myself. I
think I'm counting on the Reagan Scholarship (my parents) for the rest,
and considering that it is not just a race, it's for a good cause, and
any donations are tax-deductable, I really don't think they'll mind
(they offered to when I told them about the ride at the beginning of the
summer too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Projects update (Toaster and Website)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this is going to be a short one, I haven't done anything with the
toaster, I was hoping Dave would get back to me but he has probably been
busy...I think Del did mention that his dad had an alternator for me
though, so I gotta ask about that. As for the website, the transition
from blog --&gt; journal is now complete with updated titles on every
page...and I have been making other small additions...like the Facebook
link on the resume page is new. I did that one just b/c I thought that
logo was really cool haha, and so I stole it (shhhh!) for my link. And I
think that it does kinda apply. Next to come is either a Google Maps API
or some sort of Twitter/Facebook feed integrated in... and eventually
then I'll make m.andyreagan.com, a mobile site haha.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Merica!</title><link href="/2009/07/06/merica/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-06T17:44:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-07-06T17:44:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-07-06:/2009/07/06/merica/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just changed the classification of this blog from that of a "blog" to

I looked up the difference, which is that blogs are typically less about

almost like news. Well, this is definitely not that, since I pretty much
just write about myself haha. I am still planning a "blog" entry on
libertarianism and some others that I forgot about at the moment that I

&lt;h4&gt;The Weekend: Sun's out, guns out....Stars out, cigars out.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start out by saying that I rode my bike every day Thursday
through Sunday, which is a pretty good start back into training. And
that I came up with the latter rule in this title, both of which I
followed at some point. Thursday I rode on the trainer, since it was
raining, and I ended up doing an out and back on Frank Gay for a
cool-down since the rain had let up, and then ran up and down the street
a few times, totalling like 2.5miles running. It was funny, every time I
ran/biked by Del's house, Sarah yelled my name and I waved back but I
don't think she ever saw me wave b/c she kept yelling every time haha.
Then Thursday night the usual gang hung out at Del's, Hannah was there
with Dan and she didn't talk much but I think she had fun too. Friday I
fit in an extended-Pleasant Valley loop bike ride, taking Frank Gay to
Howlett to Cervale through the 13 curves to Pleasant Valley as usual,
but feeling ambitious went up Stevens to Seal and back Slate Hill. Then
from the village, instead of going up the Turnpike or Howlett, I took
the Gorge to that road that connect to Munro below the big hill, which
is a really nice road to ride on, and took that to Munro, up the "big"
hill on Munro, and Frank Gay home. I think that map would definitely
help haha. I stopped to talk to Meghan about possibly heading to
Geneseo/Letchworth this weekend, and might've helped her dad fix her
bike, but I don't think I did much lol. Then I saw Kaelyn driving, as I
was about to turn left onto the Turnpike from Frank Gay she was turning
onto FG, and so she stopped and we talked for like 20 minutes, even
though I knew Zdan was already at my house for my "cookout" haha. I
think I talked about a lot of this in my last blog about triathlon,
actually....wait, I mean my last "entry" haha. But yeah then me and Dan
went to Kaelyn's that night and she had some awesome fireworks, even
though she said that they weren't gonna be that cool this year. I know
that last year at her grad party I was like blown away... it is pretty
cool how the whole lake does the campfire around the lake thing and they
do fireworks all around on the 3rd. Saturday, my bike "ride" wasn't so
much of a training ride as it was a means of transportation. I rode down
to the Park for BP09, which was a "bust" with only 8 people, but it was
fun even though it wasn't a huge party...we ended up going up to Kyle
Blackmer's house to grill and hang out by his pool. After biking up New
Seneca and Limeledge, jumping in that pool felt great! At about 3, I
headed out and biked over to Steph Bingham's grad party and hung out
there for awhile before biking home and going to Jack's. I think that
altogether I put in about 15 miles just biking around town, so I guess
it saved me like \$2!! Jack's was a ton of fun, with Slade and Shields
there. A lot of his ACP, Albany College of Pharmacy, friends were there
and they were pretty cool. And nothing beats being able to walk home and
spend the night in my own bed...Shields slept in our guest bed too. I
told Slade that he could probably grab a couch if he wanted but he was
fine with his car haha. And then Sunday, I slept in till 11:30, which is
definitely a record for the past few months. I went to mass, and then
for a 38 mile ride around Otisco Lake, taking well more than 2 hours
this time. I met a guy named Bob who I caught up to going along the east
side of the lake, and talked to him for 7 miles or so, before I took
off. I wish more of my closer friends biked, but I think that the
"Marcellus Tri Club" fbook group that I decided I'm going to create may
give me some people to ride with! The only guy I thought of who might do
it is Dan Z, I suppose Shields could too but he'd be gone for the race,
and I guess I'm not sure that he can run. So other than that bike ride,
I didn't really do anything at all Sunday...got to bed at 10ish but it
still sucked getting up this morning, ugh. Well I suppose that's it for
the weekend, Steph said that she might try to do a bonfire thing tonight
and I suppose I'll go to that if Dan can come. I brought my swim stuff
today too, so I think I'll probably be stopping by the pool on my way
home!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Triathlon Time</title><link href="/2009/07/03/triathlon-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-03T17:41:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-07-03T17:41:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-07-03:/2009/07/03/triathlon-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, I officially decided that I'm going to do a

triathlon at the end of the summer. After riding the trainer yesterday
and then going for a run, and having swam on Monday, I think that I will
be able to train enough to do at least a sprint triathlon. I went for a
longer bike ride today, and it was a really good ride. Got out with the
aerobars on and the spinergy front wheel, went really fast and it felt
really good. I stopped and talked to Meghan for a while...and then I saw
Kaelyn turning on to Frank Gay and talked to her for a good 20 min. She
was on her way to go for a run with Anne and she said that her and Mary
Powers were thinking about doing a triathlon at the end of the summer
too. And that took the trouble out of finding one for me...the Caz Tri
is on Aug. 16, so I should still be around that weekend! I talked to
Galileo and I'm going to need to leave to go down on the 20th it looks
like, they said that I need to be like settled by noon on the 21st...I
think I may have gone down even earlier last year... I'm pretty excited
about this year too! There is going to be soo much work...but I think if
I make a call or two I can get my schedule fixed, which will be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm might even create a fbook group for all of the Marcellus people that
are going to do the Caz Tri haha, I think it would be me, Kaelyn, Kaity,
Mary Powers....hmm I thought there were more haha. Maybe Anne will do it
too haha. I think that would be fun, having people to train with would
be awesome! Oh, I almost forgot Carrie!! She could def do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So me and Dan Z are gonna go to Kaelyn's tonight, the fireworks on the
lake should be sweet! And Jack's is tomorrow night...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Camping, where do I start?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it all started last summer when me and Sarah Holden had some
awesome fbook conversations while we were both bored at work...and we
came up with the idea of going camping. The biggest difference that I
have noticed this summer as compared to last summer is that with a year
of college under our belts, rather than just talk about things, we plan
them and do them this summer. Like going to Toronto...for example. So I
have been camping a lot, perhaps where some of the problems/drama
started. I mean, I've done week long treks out of a canoe where we carry
all the food and gear we need for the whole week with us into the
wilderness. That's the one extrema, me. The other extrema, sorry Dan,
has to be Dan Zdanowski. He's lived in more countries than I have even
seen, but never left the comfort of running water and a warm bed at
night, ever it seems. So, I didn't wanna go to a back-your-car-up and
pitch the tent right next to it "campsite" type deal, cuz even the
thought of calling that "camping" seemed upsurd to me. Since I knew that
not everybody was going to have super advanced gear, like frame
backpacks and lightweight tents/sleeping bags, the oppposite of a
"campsite" which would be parking a trail head and ascending a mountain,
and just finding somewhere to camp, was out of the question. I spent a
great deal of time researching about different campsites and about
"backcounty" camping which was what I was thinking of. So online, I
never really found anything that like detailed a backcoutry trip, which
I guess is to be expected. I think that like a book on the ADK's would
have something like that... But anyway, it was Mrs. Zdanowski who gave
me the idea to go to "Russian Lake." It seemed perfect, a 3 mile canoe
plus one mile hike out of civilization, but not entirely remote... So I
made quite few phone calls, and got the low down on renting some canoes,
and did that, talking to Sarah and Zdan and Dknick all that day that I
rented them. So that night, I spent a lot of time making up a pretty
detailed packing list and description of the trip, from everything that
I had. Unfortunately the title "Please read THOROUGHLY if you're
camping!!!" wasn't enough to make Zdanowski read it, but why would he
need my advice on what to bring camping, anyway? So some pretty
"hairbrain" ideas came up like putting drying sheets in the food and
spreading clorox around the campsite to deter bears, and I wanted none
of it, and I was trying to be helpful by telling Sarah and Dan Z that we
didn't need that stuff. I definitely used some harsher terms...probably
where I went wrong, I think I was little too mean to Sarah there. What
really suprised me was how obstanate Zdan was, I mean being such a smart
kid and all, still wanting to pour chemicals on the ground that reach
our drinking water after reading 50 reports a day about chemical
disasters at SRC...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a half day Friday so that we could get up there, and at Del's
when we were about to leave is when I think things exploded. I got
there, and we all waited for Zdan and Fox for a good 20 minutes to show
up...and when they did, I started putting my stuff in Fox's car. I
didn't have that much, but his car was brinking on full from the two of
them's stuff and beverages. Dan insisted that we take three cars, cuz it
wouldn't fit, and that it would somehow making coming back easier...and
as I started loading my stuff into Fox's car to make sure that it fit,
Dan just blew up. He was yelling at the top of lungs that I was outta
control and that we HAD TO TAKE A THIRD CAR!!! He even tried to take my
stuff outta the car, and was right about to go to his house to drive his
own car up...but my stuff fit, even though I didn't have a whole lot of
room in the back. He then refused to ride up with me...like refused. He
wasn't going to ride with me. This kid has quite the temper, I'm
suprised he didn't start swinging, like he did at Del in bball once. Fox
could see out the back and we were all good to go though. Dan was
stilled pissed the whole ride there, I think he eventually got over
himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More Later..&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all the time I got for now...also to come in this past weeks
edition: more about camping, my new vibram five finger shoes, relaxing
on sunday, swimming Monday with Kaity, and Bonesaw's win streak
continuing. Plus a special on my new wheelset that I picked up today!
And the toaster is still in progress, I'm planning to call my Uncle
Carl's friend Dave to get some help building it, he's really interested
in this stuff. And I found a fully assembled one online, following a
lead from Lauren seeing one on Rob and Big, some show on MTV, thanks
Lauren! You can check their
out &lt;a href="http://www.econvergence.net/electro.htm"&gt;here,&lt;/a&gt; I think that I
might have to fold on the alternator or finding a DC induction motor of
my own, and buy theirs. It's \$150...which I think I did the math on,
and it will take me 9.13 years to make that much money back in
electricity, biking 1 hour a day at 250W with electricity at 18 cents
per kWh. But hey, that might actually be doable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;New Stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a look at some of my most recent purchases...first the "shoes."
I'd seen them around campus I think first, and thought that were pretty
interesting. I found them online, and they are called the &lt;a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/"&gt;Vibram Five
Fingers.&lt;/a&gt; Since the sizing needed to
be pretty precise, and I didn't want to trust the sizing chart that they
had online of a conversion from my regular shoe size for something like
that, I really had to find them in store. Online, they have a store
locator and there wasn't one in Blacksburg, and not one anywhere near
Syracuse. My only hope would have been to stop somewhere in Roanoke on
my way up for the summer...so I wasn't really able to get them. It
wasn't until a few weeks ago that I think Kyle mentioned that one of his
friends had got a pair, I checked their store locator online and found
one in Syracuse! It was at J Michael Shoes, on SU Campus...so I gave
them a call and took Eric W. with me on an adventure through the city to
find the place and after finally just parking somewhere and walking
there, I finally got to try some on. The red open-top ones that had
looked good online didn't actually look right on a foot haha, maybe my
feet are too white, but I ended up going with an all-black model that
covers the whole foot, and they are definitely less obnoxious than the
other choices...the thought crossed my mind to try to get away with them
at work, but I don't think that's gonna happen haha. You really don't
notice them unless you look kinda close... So I ran around the yard that
night (I think it was last Tuesday) and was amazed at how comfortable
they were. I really didn't want to take them off haha. I didn't get
another chance to really wear them that week, but wore them camping and
got some good use of them as water shoes and even some "trail running."
Overall, I'm really happy with the shoes, I think they'll hold up pretty
well too. Not sure that I'll ever be able to run with them on pavement
though haha...well without furthur adue (spelling...?) here they are: (I
hope this comes out right with my html...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...don't have pix (moved from older blog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, my new aero wheelset! I think that every cyclist wants an aero
wheelset, but I wasn't about to put up the &gt;\$1000 for a limited-use
wheelset...and my paired, bladed spokes were about as aero as I was ever
gonna get in college. But, being on the OCC listserv finally paid off,
after 100's of emails about doping debates and stuff, I can across the
sale of set of Spinergy Rev-X (4-spoke) carbon wheels! I looked on ebay,
and found that they were going for like 100/wheel so I emailed the
person who listed it to the oCC, and he gave me the contact of the
person who was actually selling them, so I emailed and then called her
and took Eric on yet another excursion after work, and we drove to
Liverpool or something like that to check out these wheels. As it turned
out, the person selling them was the ex-wife of the previous owner of
all this bike stuff, and it was hers now, so she was looking to get rid
of some of the stuff in her basement. I offered her 200 for each wheel,
even though the rear has a sizeable ding, that was a really good deal
for an aero wheelset I think. I'm still all excited about them, and even
put on my aerobars with the front wheel to prepare my bike for that time
trial environment of the triathlon, which includes the &lt;a href="http://www.great-race.com/"&gt;Great
Race&lt;/a&gt; in August, which me and Lindz will
hopefully be doing the tandem in! So now all I got all the equipment for
my triathlon...short maybe a swim cap, all I gotta do is keep learning
how to swim and actually riding my bike and I'll be all set! Here's a
look of the bike set up, with all the wheels:&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Rainy Days</title><link href="/2009/06/22/rainy-days/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-22T17:35:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-22T17:35:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-06-22:/2009/06/22/rainy-days/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm actually beginning to realize that this is less of a blog and more

&lt;h4&gt;Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much the whole weekend from Thursday-on was dreary weather...so
I'm not going to keep complaing about that but it did suck. No biking,
and no ice cream, and obv. nothing outside b/c of the rain! I don't know
about you, but I can't get excited to go get ice cream when it is cloudy
and rainy out...After work I was going to watch Zdanowski coach a
baseball game in the Valley, but it was cancelled due to rain, so we
went to dinner instead still watched a movie after. We went to Luigi's,
where I got the "tour of italy," not what they called it but that's what
I ordered haha. It was good, and I think Carly and Kate and Dan all
enjoyed their ziti too. I even met someone who has ties to VT, I was
wearing a VT Cycling shirt and a woman asked me if I went there when she
was leaving, and told me her son does. Go Hokies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the movie, Kate insisted that we watch Taken, since she was the only
one who had seen it. Not that I was opposed though haha, I just don't
like watching movies that I have seen where there are so many other
choices! Basically, the movie was really intense, Liam
somethin-or-other, the main actor, just owned up all the noobs and got
his daughter back. There were only a few parts that bugged me from the
realism, like him hiding from machine gun fire behind a couch, but all
those bullets, and others, could have jsut missed him outta luck I
suppose too. But he still kicked some ass, luck or not, and I thought it
was really good haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Friday...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I don't really remember what exactly I did Friday...haha JK.
Gotcha! We played basketball at the park at 6, like always, with the
bball guys. My Dad came too, keeping getting in top shape! All I really
remember about basketball though is that I gaurded Jeff the whole night,
and he is quick as hell. My shoes were sliding on the pavement trying to
keep up with his cuts, but I think I kept up with him regardless, I'm
gonna name myself as the team "defensive specialist" for the 3 on 3
league that start's not this Thursday, but the next. Zdanowski stopped
by at like 7:30 with a girl he knows from Brockport at like 7:30, and
since he was heading out in an hour and we were still playing
basketball, it didn't look like I was gonna make it to JD with him for
the night. So I was just gonna watch a movie and relax, and I was txting
Carly at the time so she came over to keep me company! :) We watched
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," which neither of us had seen, and
I thought that it was really good too, two good movies in a row!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lazy Saturday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That movie was like over 3 hours long though, and I didn't even realize
that until the movie was over and it was 12:30...I was thinkin wth, but
it was just a long movie! So I slept in till a record 11 o'clock,
getting in solid 10 hours, which I think I really needed. The rest of
the day followed suit, I didn't do much of anything. Me and Del and
Dknick went to the bluewater for dinner, which was really good, and
Sarah got off early so she joined us to eat too. We drove up to the mall
after cuz we were bored basically, and I got my Bro a bday present, so
that was good. Then me and Dan just chilled in Del's room for the night,
it was pretty fun actually. That's about it though haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sun &amp;amp; Mon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Sunday, the weather sucking=no biking! And it also means over 100
emails from the OCC listserve too aparently...but then the weather did
get nicer later in the day I guess, and I went on a run with my Mom and
then played basketball with my Dad, I gotta keep 'em both in shape! But
I can't really take any credit for keeping my Mom motivated to run, she
just enjoys it! We went like 3.5 miles, and my legs are still sore today
from that!! I kept up just fine though, might have even pushed her pace
at times, definitely did up the hill, but by the end I was done, and
struggled all the way to the very end of the street, but I made it! Then
in the third game of basketball, the tie breaker, it was tie game at
15-15 and as I drove by him, his "good defensive position" left those
knobby knees sticking out and I took one during full acceleration
through my thigh, and I was down for the count. I didn't even think I
was going to walk Monday, literally. After 10 minutes or so, and being
taunted about forfeit, I hobbled around for another minute or two so
that my Dad could win* the series. I'm keeping the asterisk there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was my uber-productive day of the week. I don't even think I can
list all the stuff I got done. The phone's were a ringin, for sure.
Basically, I planned the camping trip for all of us this weekend which
comprised many many phones call to them and the friends and paying for
canoes and printing maps, got a hold of and got some answers from Bike &amp;amp;
Build, found out about getting some sweet vibram five-finger shoes which
I'm hopefully gonna pick up on my way home from work today, prepared a
clothing order to ship in the morning, talked with Verizon and got my
Storm ordered online (it's in the mail!!), wrote a long letter to
Lauren, filled out an afidavid (spelling?), and so much more haha. And
I'm getting to bed in time for 6 hours of sleep!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Champions!</title><link href="/2009/06/17/champions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-17T17:34:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-17T17:34:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-06-17:/2009/06/17/champions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Big news: X-Factor, formerly know as Bonesaw, won the Marcellus Park

Pick-Up Sand Volleyball League Tournament on Tuesday. The roster
included three Reagans: myself, my Dad, and my Mom. Along with us was
Andy Caster, Ryan Del, and Jenn Daley. Me, Andy, and Jenn played almost
every week last year without a victory, and with the help of some
strategic position and bump-set-spike play, claimed our first crown this
year the first week of play, without losing on the way there!! It was a
lot of fun overall, the other teams were pretty cool, although obnoxious
at times...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening, I forwent playing basketball at the Park to officially
join and go for my second ride with the OCC. It was a really good ride,
totaling 34 miles, though slightly shortened with the threat of rain.
For about 10 minutes, some guy named Paul pulled us into a stiff
headwind and on a slight uphill at over 28 mph...and by the time we
reached Jordan (about 40 minutes in) we were at 23.4 mph AVERAGE! It
slowed down slightly, but we still finished over 20 mph, a pretty solid
ride. I think that puts me up to like 80 some miles with the OCC, and
only two rides. After the ride, a few of the guys asked me if I was on a
race team, which was pretty cool. I must've ridden fast or something? I
did pull the first few miles to seperate the six of us from sight of any
of the other riders... The worst part was that in a rush to get there, I
forgot to bring any water or food, and after getting lost twice on the
way there and taking the long way home I was starving and pretty frickin
thirsty! I got lost on the way there because on Warners road, in some
park on the right, there was a ton of bikers and bikes on cars so I
stopped there thinking that maybe they changed the start location...and
then they told me that the OCC ride started right around the corner at
Airport Rd but after driving a mile down that way...that was also wrong,
it was where the directions pointed all along! Possibly the coolest part
of the ride, besides the crazy pull by Paul, was seeing two fawns, more
precisely stopping for them to cross the road so close that I could've
touched them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been getting a lot of hits for clothing since Tim posted the
leftover list to the VT team site, which is pretty cool. Lots of Tech
alums and new riders, exciting!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Same Ol'</title><link href="/2009/06/16/same-ol/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-16T17:33:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-16T17:33:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-06-16:/2009/06/16/same-ol/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunday I did manage to get out to go for a bike ride, and met my parents

down at Marcellus Park to play volleyball...I saw some girls I knew from
high school playing on the other court too, but me and my parents play
against some random people who weren't very good at all, which made it
somewhat difficult to get some good practice for Tuesday, which is why
we went down there in the first place, but by letting them serve (they
had trouble returning any) we were able to get some practice setting and
such. I rode my bike home, so I got a good 20 miles total, which now
does feel like a shorter ride. Problem with rides longer than that is
that well, they take so much longer and I haven't felt like riding for
quite so long recently...idk. That was pretty much it for Sunday, I
think I might've thrown the frisbee around with my dad some too when I
got home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to make some progress on the toaster, I took apart the
toaster oven that I bought and hooked it up to my powermeter. At full
power, it consumes 1,330 watts, which I am definitely not going to be
able to deliver. After dismantling the toaster over though, it would be
super easy to move the heating rods closer to the bread, and even to
take two of them out. I also made progress toward an alternator, sending
out like 10 emails to craigslist listings of assorted motorcycle, and
have so far gotten two reponses about alternators. I was hoping since
they were craigslist syracuse that they would be local, but having not
paid attention to that while looking for the listings, both of the ones
that got back to me are far away enough that they will have to be
shipped. They're in Rochester and Niagra Falls, and one guy wanted 30
for his off an 87 Honda CBR1000 and the other didn't give a price yet
but he said it was in great shape, only 1600 miles, and only had to sell
it cuz the bike was crashed at the frame bent. I think that I'm going to
call my uncle Carl too, to see what ideas he has on where to get one...I
do think that car alternator would be too big (again 80amps X 12V = 960
watts) so maybe his friend Dave will have one lying around, something
from a snowmobile would probably be about right too. When I got to
looking at NiChrome wire to use to make my own toaster, since the
toaster oven will probably be too power-hungry, I think that I ran into
yet another technical problem. The coils in all of these types of
heaters have resistances, measured in Ohms, that are designed and ideal
for 120V circuits. Doesn't sound on the surface like so much of a
problem, but a lenght of wire that has a total resistance of say 50 Ohms
will resist a given amount of current, resistance is the opposition to
current, and so where a 120V input will have a smaller current that 12V
input of equal power, the current of the 12V circuit will be 10 times
that of the 120V for an equal amount of wattage (power), so when trying
to push current through a 50 ohm wire at 12V, that will seem like 500
Ohms at 120V!! So I will need different wire or to somehow step up my
voltage...different wire will probably be the most economic choice in
that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight is volleyball at the park, and it should be a lot of fun. For
sure, I think we've got me, my Dad, Del, and Andy Caster. Andy was going
to try to get ahold of Sarah Clere and Jenn Daley, who played with us
last summer. Sarah Holden has a lax game later...Zdan has baseball
stuff...and Carly has a play recital but they should be able to make it
in the coming weeks. Dan I think is good in July, and Carly's practice
times will be different week to week I think...but hopefully we can get
a pretty consistent group together and it will be a lot of fun. Tuesday
is the night that everything else seems to happen on though...both the
time trials and the TNTS which are the big rides for the Onondaga
Cycling Club are that night all summer...and I'm not sure what else is
Tuesdays but I remember there being even more haha...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;a href="http://www.onondagacyclingclub.org/"&gt;Onondaga Cycling Club&lt;/a&gt;
(OCC), I am definitely going to join. There is a ride Wednesday night
that I am going to go to, the guy leading it seems pretty cool, his name
is Anthony Baleno I think. He sent out a request for somebody else to
lead the ride starting at Marcellus on the 27th, which I offered to do,
I mean it's in Marcellus Park! Sarah Holden mentioned that we should go
camping that weekend, so maybe I can't lead the ride, but either should
be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Livin for the Weekends</title><link href="/2009/06/14/livin-for-the-weekends/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-14T17:32:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-14T17:32:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-06-14:/2009/06/14/livin-for-the-weekends/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Friday&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is work, and 40 hour weeks are the worst. Friday marked the
conclusion of my fourth week of work! Really hard to believe that I have
been home for over four weeks! But, I haven't been home all that time
either, having road tripped one weekend to Toronto and travelled for one
of my races to Corning. The highlight of the day may have been my Mom
making omelets in the morning haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday night, we had a dudes night of sorts at Del's house, which was a
lot of fun. It was me, Del, Zdan, and Knickerbocker. Sarah was there for
a little but she headed out after her friends weren't coming. Without
gasoline, it would've been a toss up if we were going to have a fire or
not, and man that stuff is fun to play with. Put some on the wood, and
lead a little trail out to start it, and phooom the whole thing lights
up. Problem is, it would do that and then go right out the first few
times...we actually had to get some wood smaller than logs haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saturday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard about the village of Marcellus having a big yard sale from my
Mom reading the paper on Thursday I think, and where better to find an
old toaster? I had been telling Megan G. that we were gonna hang out, so
I took her down the big yard sales to help me find a toaster...and even
though she was pretty convinced that I wouldn't find one, I found the
perfect toaster over from, of all people, Andy Caster's mom, and it was
only \$5, perfect, but I did carry their basketball pole from the
backyard out to the driveway haha. Small world...only problem now though
is that the toaster is rated at 1440 watts! There's absolutely no way
that I can make that much power for an extended period of
time...especially with the inefficiency of a car alternator. What I need
to do is figure out how it works, and hook it up to my P3 power meter
and see how much power it actually consumes. But now all I need is the
alternator, and important selection, and some wiring and such. I think I
might go to an outlet from the alternator so I can both use my power
meter and not destroy the toaster power cord. If this toaster toasts a
piece of bread in 2-3 minutes normally, I think for me to toast it in 15
would be pretty good. The idea of the bike-powered toaster is to take
that 30 minute morning warm up bike and make something useful from it,
so really anything under 30 would be a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the yard sales, we came back to my house and watched "The Big
Lebowski.' I'd heard good things about it, it got an 8.2/10 on imdb, and
it was good, but perhaps less than I was expecting. Maybe I need to
watch it again haha. Me and my Dad decided that we have to watch O
Brother Where Art Thou again, after he misquoted it the other day, which
is unacceptable. After watching the movie, I just chilled around the
house basically until going to Jack's for yet another bonfire. A lot
different though, there were a ton of people and most of them were
camping Jack's back yard for the night haha. Pretty nice that I live
walking distance...and so that was fun, Zdanowski couldn't stay, again,
cuz he had to get up for baseball, again, but like everybody was there
so it was cool. Pretty glad I wasn't going to be sleeping like 12 people
to that 6 man tent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Today&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I just work up about an hour ago and sat down to eat some cereal,
but am instead sharing my thought to the world. Del wants to play
tennis, which is pretty random, but I think I'm gonna go for a ride if I
ever get around to it. It sucks that I don't know anybody else my age
around here who rides...the only person I can think of is Tommy Forte
but I don't really know him. Frickin Shields had to blow out his knee so
that he doesn't want to bike anymore and save what strength his knee
does have for water skiing, which I guess I can't blame him for but I
need somebody to ride with! Other than that I got no plans, maybe I'll
beef up my blog some more later haha. Or I could look into making a
comment bar....but it's not like anybody reads this. I was going to use
google analytics and their tracking cookies so that I could see how many
people come to my site and what pages they visit and for how long, but I
think I would just be disappointed lol cuz I wouldn't have any data to
work with cuz nobody visits! Maybe they do, who knows, so don't block my
cookies!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Another Day In Marcellus</title><link href="/2009/06/11/june-11-2009/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-11T17:31:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-11T17:31:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-06-11:/2009/06/11/june-11-2009/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On only the second day of having my blog working, I missed a day...I

would've like to have had one every day for at least a week. Maybe I
don't have that much to say after all. Tuesday, I didn't end up doing
either OCC ride, stopped on my way home to drop off a computer at
Westcott, and got home at 4 which was nice. Then I got talked into
playing basketball again somehow, so I took the extra long way there on
my bike, getting in a 15 mile ride before playing 2 hours of basketball.
I got my Dad to come down which was good, and my team finally won one
against Jeff, Del and their crew. The weather was much nicer (no rain!)
so I was glad I put on sunscreen haha, and the best news is that I got a
good clean dunk. Now Del definitely can't say the ONLY think that I can
dunk is a water bottle. I still deny dunking any writing utensils lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I didn't really do much of anything at all, except for
getting in a bike ride. I went out towards Skaneatles on Old Seneca,
turned back up Stump by Welch-Allyn, and wound around so that I came
back up Munro. That area on (not sure what road it is) but up from the
Gorge connecting to Munro is really nice, tons of nice houses. I didn't
get away without seeing anyone I know either, saw Sam Wickett at the
bottom of Lawless, and even helped her pull out (checked if there were
cars coming haha). Then I just lounged around like a bum and watched the
Family Guy movie and part of Beavis and Butthead which, for some reason,
Kyle had his heart set on watching...but he left to fork the lawn of the
high school and I think I that I was getting too much dumber from
watching that "movie" so I went to bed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that the only other things going on are that we're definitely
putting in a volleyball team next Tuesday at the park, hopefully with
some volleyball players on it (Carly!) and that I have discovered the
awesome confusion of filing taxes. Actually, laugh if you will, I just
had to fill out my W-4 for work, buuut establishing residency in
Virginia is making things more complicated, I actually wrote my NY
address down the first time! And so apparently I have to file taxes with
both states too. Who knows. On a sour note, there was mold on the bread
for my sandwhiches today for lunch which I almost ate haha and on a
positive ending note, my new Oakley lenses should be shipping out today
from Mr. Ben Warren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another positive note, I (with the "help" of my Mom) got the links on
the site to open externally. But bad news for all of you still using IE6
or earlier, I don't feel like fixing my logo for your out-of-date
browser so I'm not gonna do it. Upgrade or die!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The New Site, Basketball in the Rain, and Summer Projects</title><link href="/2009/06/09/june-9-2009/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-09T17:30:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-09T17:30:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-06-09:/2009/06/09/june-9-2009/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first entry using the new webpage, and there's a lot going

on. I'm editing the html for the page and just typing in the code as I
go to update it, but this should work pretty well. This page is not
actually hosted from my own server, but I do now have complete control
over it, unlike before when I was using the free "easy site" that came
with my domain name registration. I can edit the content however I want,
and even add new pages if I feel like. I guess my only limit is 30MB of
content, and that's going to be the only thing pushing me to still try
to get a server running. So shoot me and email (upper right) if you have
any suggestions for the page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, I just added a new link at the very bottom which points to a
currently non-existent page, but will point to a blog archive when it's
time for that. Just to keep this page from getting light-years long I
guess. I think that all the pages have some use, the sample work being
perhaps the only one that could be cut, perhaps folded under resume, but
I see no reason to do that. I'm actually having a lot of fun editing the
content on all these pages and stuff. Someday, I'll publish a blog or
write something about how I ended up with this site the way it is, from
it's very beginnings. So other people can have just as much fun as I do
with their own web pages! We (the page and I) are only about 6 months
in, so it is probably to early to start writing the chronology anyway.
The server will be the most challenging part after all, at least I think
it will be, and I haven't even finished that yet. When I get around to
it, I think I'll convert all of the documents on here to .pdf, they open
so nicely in the browser with a download button and all. And, I'll need
to figure out how to make external links open in a seperate page. The
problem right now is that it still looks like you're in andyreagan.com
when you're not. And internet explorer 6 doesn't like my logo at the
top, but it works with the lastest IE, firefox, and chrome so I don't
think I'm going to bother to fix it. I also removed my phone number for
like 5 minutes, but I like it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Last Night&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to just get in a light bike ride as a recovery ride from riding
50 miles on Sunday, which was an awesome ride btw. But, Del and Fox were
trying to get bball together at the park, and Del forced me to come even
though it looked like it was gonna rain. Sure enough, as we're driving
down there it starts raining, so there we were sitting in the Sarah's
car in the pouring rain, 15 minutes early to boot, and thinking what the
hell Del lol. But as, we were leaving after waiting around for 5
minutes, we saw Fox driving in, and he said everyone else was still
coming. Jeff Watson showed up, he brought Mark Rudy and Fiacchi showed
up, so we had enough for 3 on 3. It was still raining, and Mark was sure
that someone was going to break an ankle, but we didn't melt and I was
actually the only one to lose so skin on my knee from slipping. The
court was what I pictured it would be like playing "broomball," some
game my Mom told me that they used to play at Potsdam on the hockey
rink, using brooms to hit a ball around. We played for a long time, and
it was a lot of fun, I played pretty well. It was funny one time when I
went to drive on Del, I faked and he slipped a little on the wet court,
so I went right by him to score on him for the second time and Jeff was
giving him the hardest time lol. Maybe you had to be there. I did end up
riding the rollers for like 30 min and then rolling out my legs with the
foam roller, painful to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summer Projects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have all the time in the world, but as for my two projects this
summer, the website and the bike toaster, I think that website is coming
right along. Part of that was going to be getting my server up and
running, but seeing as how easy this to update, I might pass on that. I
actually opened up my Dad's old electrical theory book from back in the
day when he was in college, to read about alternators and generators for
the toaster. I think I'm definitely learning something, namely that
voltage won't matter for resistance heating and that alternators are
superior to dc generators because they don't need brushings. I thought
about trying to step up the competition between me and David Henry to
build the best toaster by saying that we should have to make our own
generators, but on second thought...probably not gonna want to do that.
The concept really isn't that complicated, we would have to buy some
insulated copper wire, and "rare earth" magnets. The latter can be
scrapped from old hard drives, apparently. And the wire wouldn't be very
expensive either. The site that gave me the inspiration to even think
about building it myself
is &lt;a href="http://www.otherpower.com/"&gt;otherpower.com&lt;/a&gt;. But getting those
magnets to spin freely perpendicular to the longer side of the coils
(which is the idea I think) is kinda more than I really feel like doing.
I ran into a problem when looking at the RPM-Amp output curves for
typical car alternators...basically it's way to steep. If it's too
steep, then I'll basically have to create the full power of the
alternator (for an 80A alternator, 80amps X \~13V = 1000W) to generate
any power at all. Assuming that the alternator is about 60% efficient,
which I think I saw somewhere, and that I'll lose at 10% to the
drivetrain of my bike, resistance of the rollers, and belt transfer to
the alternator, I would have to generate 2000W to make that alternator
go. Ain't gonna happen. Since I don't think anybody is still reading
(not giving my secrets to Dave), my thought was to use a weaker
motorcycle alternator, only capable of 30-40 amps and with a more linear
output curve. But the pick-n-pull in Auburn only has one motorcycle, and
it is lacking an alternator (I called).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;(Today)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, we're (the interns here at OBG) are going to get to meet with
Terry Brown, the CEO, and get a free lunch outta the deal. Also, I set
up a laptop for this guy working at the Westcott resevoir, and I think
I'll get to go out the jobsite to get it to him, should be good. And
tonight, there are two cycling events going on (as there are every
Tuesday apparently), the TNTS, Tuesday Night Training Series, and a time
trial. I brought my bike, and aerobars, in the car in hopes to go to the
time trial tonight, so hopefully the rain holds. I'm gonna stay a little
later at work and go straight there too, since it's in Clay and it would
dumb to drive home and then drive right back up here. But it may work
out that way, we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now folks!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>May 15, 2009</title><link href="/2009/05/15/may-15-2009/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-15T17:29:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-05-15T17:29:00+02:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-05-15:/2009/05/15/may-15-2009/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the semester is over and I survived, physically at the least, my

freshman year of college. I've been home for a day now and I am
definitely glad to be back, this summer is gonna be a lot of fun.
Hopefully being frugal doesn't get in the way of that too much haha.
Just looked and I got a 66 on the chemistry final which is disappointing,
a class that I was planning on an A in but it threw an impossible final
at us all. The good news is that with a 3.5 point curve, I'm looking at
an A- still, and with no curve at all a B, so most likely a B+ b/c he
has gotta curve that at least some. Sustainability grades are coming in
also and they are looking promising, and I already know I got an A in
english, which was by no means a breeze. In ES and English this semester
I feel like I wrote some of the best papers that I ever have.
Engineering is so annoying, and they take forever to post grades. And
DiffEq is still up in the air, I got a 93 on the final though so I
hoping for an A, I'll take an A- at this point I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for grades really, I'm excited to work at OBG again this
summer and hopefully make some coin for next year, seeing as I'll
definitely need it. It's 2:30AM now, so I'm looking to get to bed, but
just wanted to say to all my fans and listeners that I think the
semester went well, I know should know more definitively soon anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh, as far as the semester, I finished 5th in my division in the
ACCC in cycling, which I am pretty happy with. Came into the
championship weekend seated 3rd, but put the most work into the team
time trial, which doesn't count for individual standings, but winning
that ttt was awesome and definitely worth whatever it did take! Shout
out to Travis, Nick, and Andrew for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other fun things went down too, including beating the track team's
finest in the 100m on my bike. I raced Nick Vaughn at the VT track on
Saturday, and won by half of a wheel length, it was really intense.
There's a video I put on facebook and you can see the race go down
somewhat, but can't tell who wins really from the video. Other fun
happenings included the Tour de Franzia and some other successful
weekends/cigar nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now I suppose. Looking forward to this summer!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Spring Break 2009</title><link href="/2009/03/16/spring-break-2009/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-16T17:26:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-03-16T17:26:00+01:00</updated><author><name>andyreagan</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-03-16:/2009/03/16/spring-break-2009/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's now spring break 2009, and the semester has been awesome so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as classes go, I'm looking at mostly A's I think, with the
exception of Proofs which is pretty hard but I'll see what I can do I
guess, I'm not dropping it. Differential equations isn't that much less
work the second time around, but it is going a lot better, I got 100 on
our only test so far. I really like Chem 2, and my teacher, which is
good since I am planning on being a Chemical Engineer. I tied six of my
peers for the highest grade on our only English paper so far, and since
apparently engineers aren't good at english, I'll take that. The second
semester of the intro engineering course has seems a lot more useful, we
actually learned something with AutoDesk Inventor and we find out about
the test we took before spring break after break. Earth Sustainability
has also been more interesting this semester I think, our focus up to
this point has been energy. More than I ever wanted to know about the
history of it at least haha, but this is after all the sector of
sustainability that I am most interested in helping when I get out as a
ChemE and Math guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that work takes up almost all my time, but I have been racing my
bike on the weekends and that is also going well. My mom and Lauren and
her brother were able to make it to my last race at William and Mary,
where I broke up the field and led the first of two laps after a short
sprint up the hill to the start/finish line, but my legs were dead from
the sprint so I couldn't hang onto the break, and finished at the end of
the chase group, right behind my three fellow hokies. I think I could've
been smarter and finished better, but I had a really good time and I
think that I am getting stronger as the season has been going, and as
long as it's 80 degrees, sunny, and my friends are there to watch I'd
much rather have fun than be overly concerned about how I place...for
now haha. For more info about cycling, visit our &lt;a href="http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu/"&gt;VT team
site&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.acccycling.org/"&gt;ACCC conference's
site&lt;/a&gt;, for results and schedules and the
sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune in later for more!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
