    <p>A short three weeks ago, I signed up for the Big Lick Triathlon, for
which there is only one distance: olympic. I was scared about the 1 mile
swim, but felt I could crush the 25mi bike and would somehow survive the
6 mile run. Having signed up, I immediately started training hard,
starting with three workouts the day I signed up! Now, having swam
consistently over the past two weeks I actually feel very confident
about the swim, having had my best workout yet tonight. I went from
barely being able to swim a 50, and I couldn’t even finish 2 50’s…to
today doing a 300 warm up, 6×75 with almost no rest, 4×200 with 15 sec
rest, and 4×50 with 10sec rest (on the 60), and still felt strong but
was out of time and did a comfortable 100 cool-down. Pretty amazing how
far I’ve come, but we’ll see how it happens in the open water. On the
weekends, I’ve been beating myself up on the mountain bike, and have
been doing wednesday worlds as my only other bike ride really for
training on the bike…which I have somewhat neglected and am just
counting on base fitness really.  I haven’t been running too much
either, but did 7 miles yesterday morning followed by a long 2.5hr bike
ride.  That, on top of a hard weekend of racing and the 10+ miles I
commute every day on my fixie…my legs didn’t want to move this morning.
 But they did, and again I felt great swimming.  I’m going to take it
easy the next few days, with possibly an suuper easy bike then run
tomorrow, and then an open water swim in the wetsuit on Friday
hopefully.</p>
<p>All things considered, I couldn’t be more excited for this weekend.
 I’ve got all the gear, including a wet suit from Alex Brown, a race
belt and timing chip strap (that I can’t find at the moment though).  I
put the aero bars on the bike, and yesterday wore the aero helmet during
the ride…I really could’ve used more time in that position though, but
from what I hear Big Lick is hilly.  Today’s picture is all of that gear
laid out, pretty much everything I’ll be taking this weekend. (Plus the
MTB for racing Sunday at App State and some other things I couldn’t find
haha).</p>
