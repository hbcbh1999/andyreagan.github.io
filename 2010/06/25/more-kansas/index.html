    <p>The past two days we have traversed the beautiful Kansas countryside,
not at all flat or monotonous, it's been awesome! Both days, into Beloit
and Phillipsburg we've got to swim in pools to cool off and have again
ate great food.  Some of the sights today included being chased by a
3-legged dog that could run 18MPH (yes!), seeing a deer gallop through a
cornfield which looked like a dolphin how it came above the corn haha,
seeing what we thought was a real bison (but was really only a cut out
far away) and just yeah, some great bike riding and fun.</p>

<h4>And into Phillipsburg today!</h4>
<p>Today I got a little late start, per usual but a group of 6 of us
cruised pretty good.  I pulled from the host for about 8 miles, as we
passed just about everyone else.  When I went to pull off, I looked
behind me and the WHOLE TEAM had jumped on, I was pulling all like 25!!
That was fun haha, and we didn't see below 20mph with the tailwind, all
the way to... (at mile 19)</p>

<p>I put a pin in Marcellus NY and Emma got Blacksburg, neither were done!
There were some Syracuse though.  I may or may not have taken a 3 inch

<p>I peaced out after the ball and rode hard for a while out front, then
waited for a group to catch up and we cruised all the way to lunch.  It
was cool to hold over 20 for so long...</p>

<p>After lunch, I went to the post office to mail Lindz a post card and
piece of twine for her birthday, and ended up sticking the postcard and
twine in an envelope...didn't want to trust that the tape would hold it
on a postcard.  The postlady there was super nice, and I talked to her
for awhile about what we were doing, and she made a \$10 donation to the
group!!  Thank you so much!  Again the generosity and goodness of people
that we have met from east to west is enough to restore anyone's faith
in humanity.  This country is just filled with awesome people, and
that's easy to forget watching the evening news.</p>
<p>I was behind pretty much everyone, just sweeps and Jesse and Alyson were
at lunch when I passed back by.  So I found some big gear and crushed
until I caught the rest.  They were all pretty bunched up, in little
groups spread over a quarter mile, so I just kept on cruisin through.
 When I got near the front of the groups, we hit a pretty decent little
hill and Zach was riding away from them a little bit.  So I got my
sprint on, and yelled to him that there was "No way you're getting the
KOM jersey that easy!" and passed him to the top haha.  We were by
ourselves, and riding at a better tempo felt good so we rode fast for
awhile.  I really enjoy riding with Zach, it's fun.</p>
<p>After 15 miles or so, sure enough Jesse had caught us...which must've
been some chase because we were cruisin.  The country roads were still
beautiful and we didn't see more than 1 car every 3 miles.  After some
time of going real fast, and Zach telling Jesse and I how he was an old
man haha, I spotted what could possibly be two riders ahead of us.
 Impossible...Noah was on sweep and I remember passing Derrick...but I
remembered that Heather and Jen had left lunch real early.  When we got
close, Zach told Jesse and I to "go get 'em" like we were dogs or
something haha, and I told Zach to come up beside us and we would see
who could hold 25mph the longest (by which point I'd hoped we'd have
caught them).  After a minute of pushing real hard, Zach dropped back a
little and eventually Jesse faded as well, and I decided that there was
no reason to hurt haha so I slowed down.  Jesse caught right up and then
we were with Heather.  I was gasping for air by the time we caught her,
and she seemed suprised haha.  I headed up to tell Jen how fast she
must've been going because they were so hard to catch haha.  After
another while I guess, Jesse and Zach and Jen and I took off pretty fast
again.  We kinda left Heather hangin but I guess Jen figured she could
handle it haha.</p>
<p>With only about 10 miles to go, we saw a couple riders pushing their
heavily loaded bikes up a hill. We all stopped, but Zach kept going and
Jen left shortly.  Jesse and I talked to the man and woman for a little,
and turns out that he had a flat tire.  They were biking to the east
coast, without too much plan it seemed and both of them with their
guitars.  We offered a patch kit or one of our tubes but they wouldn't
fit, so we wished eachother luck and headed off.</p>
<p>Jen was real hard to catch by that point, and after 5 miles we finally
got her haha.  Then Jesse took off to catch Zach, because Jen said that
he wanted to get there first haha ahead of me and Jesse, but I didn't
really feel like working haha.  I rode out the last 5 or so with Jen and
turns out that Jesse got him just one stoplight before the church.  Zach
wasn't really trying to stay in front, but it was fun.</p>
<p>The United Methodist Church of Phillipsburg directed us to a pool and
showers, which were awesome after we unloaded the whole trailer.  I
tried to dive pretty unsuccessfully haha but it sounded entertaining.
 Showers were nice and we went to the Chubby Pickle restaurant, famous
for their Super Chubby hamburger, which I got loaded with homemade
chili.  Swimming, good food, showers, wifi, a couch to sleep on and I
was a very happy man.</p>
<p>We had a great dinner, talking to members of the church was nice,
a chiropractor stopped by and then had a town hall meeting with the
group.</p>
<p>In about 5 hours I'll be gettin up so it's time for bed for me though!
Thanks for reading, more to come as we approach the Rocky Mountains
heading into Colorado.</p>
