    <p>Today we tallied over 1,000 miles on our journey across the country thus
far! The 60 mile ride to Terre Haute, out of Bloomington, was awesome
and flew right by.  We put in all 60 miles, lunch included, before noon!
The countryside noticeably flattened he further we went, and I could
start to see the cornfields extend for maybe half a mile, almost to the
plains for sure.</p>
<p>The morning started out with a little scare, when I went to retrieve my
bibs and jersey that I had hung up on some hangers I found to discover
that the room they were in had been locked! After a few phone calls
though, we had someone at the church to let me in there by 6:30 (an hour
after I woke up) and so it was all good.  For breakfast I had 6 bowls of
cheerios because we were trying to make space in the coolers and of
course I had to help out as much as I could lol.</p>
<p>About 10 miles in we stopped to take a stretch break, and I got in an
excellent stretch, one of the best I've had haha.  I can almost lay my
hands flat in front of my toes! At lunch, I had a delicious lunch too
and yeah the rest of the ride was smooth sailin.</p>
<p>But it's almost 11 and so we have to be back to the church, so I'll
finish tomorrow!</p>
