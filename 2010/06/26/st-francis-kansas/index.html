    <p>Today we rode 70 miles through blistering heat (the bank said 106) and a
stiff headwind to our final stop in Kansas. The riding went well, our
hosts were again spectacular with dinner, and we got to bowl for free!</p>
<p>I'm writing from my phone now but I got pictures for when we get
internet and stuff!</p>
<p>UPDATE 07/26/11: Found this in a word document: "</p>
<p>to st. francis</p>
<p>Today the riding was a little less exciting, but despite the lack of
scenery and scorching heat it was another great day! The temperature
reached 106F, and I rode pretty fast all day to try to beat the heat
into town.  I finished the day with 71 miles of riding, watched the
world cup game, showered and bought an outfit at the thrift store, ate,
talked to Lauren, and bowled!</p>
<p>Early on I started with the “Hold Me Love Me” chore group, and Mark, but
that group didn’t stay together for very long.  I ended up riding more
quickly with Mark and Noah, and after a little while Tio and Mark and I
took off.  Lunch was nice at about 36 miles, and I ate quick to head out
with the first group.  Joe, Tio, Sarah G, Mark and I were the first out,
but in a mile or so it was just Mark and I.  We were facing a pretty
stiff headwind all day, but Mark and I set a nice even pace that we held
for the next 35 miles straight.</p>
<p>We passed through two towns during the ride, distinguished from the
landscape with towering grain elevators.  This northwestern part of
Kansas has actually been the flattest."</p>
