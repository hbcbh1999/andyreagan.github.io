    <p>Today we got to sleep in until 6:30 which was great...and I was on the
couch which was awesome too, laid in bed for an extra 15 minutes as well
haha love that feeling that you're tired and want to sleep while laying
down. Anyway, the ride today was only 41 miles which everyone was very
excited for, and there was an awesome town on the way (Nashville), and
Bloomington (home of Indiana University) is really really cool.</p>
<p>We started out slow, and I pulled into the wind for awhile which was
good because I can pedal hard and get to help out other people! There
were still some inclines along the way, but no real big ones and we made
great time. About halfway on our ride we got to Nashville, and we
stopped at a super cool coffee shop and got some fudge!</p>

<p>Nashville was such a super cool town, soo many little shops it would be
easy to spend a day there for sure.  Riding out of Nashville was nice
too</p>

<p>After dinner, I realllly wanted to go find the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_500">Little
500</a>track so I headed out on my
bike to explore because that's always fun.  Bloomington is one of the
nicest college towns we've been in, I enjoyed it a lot, and the campus
was gorgeous as well.</p>

<p>I ran into a teacher at the university, and asked how to get to the
track and ended up talking to her about cycling, (she was on a bike and
commutes on one) and what I am doing and it was cool.  I had to ask
another guy before I found it haha.  I was amazed by the castle-sized
frats here, they are rediculous!</p>

<p>And then I came back and we walked over the brewery for free beer (free
water for me haha) and it was pretty cool.</p>

<p>And that was the day!! A really long day for such a short ride, but
after my campus cruising I logged over 50 miles.  Tomorrow I should
break 1000! I'll end with my favorite picture of the way, the view from
my handlebars:</p>
