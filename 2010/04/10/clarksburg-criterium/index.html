    <p>There is no way to hide a lack of training in a city block criterium,
and I certainly wasn't able to.</p>
<p>I didn't have high expectations, but it's still really hard not being
able to get on the break, and suffering on the wheel of the "chase"
group, when weeks ago I would've been crushing it in the break.  Not
sure where I finished, don't really care at moment, not point-worthy for
sure (15th maybe?).  I'm blaming it on myself here, but I did get
23.5MPH for my <em>average</em> speed, which is crushing with the tight turns
and small hills, above my TT pace haha.  Having cadence was nice, I
noticed that I liked to go at about 110 the whole race! Missed
<a href="http://mydailyground.com">Brett</a> at the race this weekend too!</p>
<p>On a positive note, Jean and Don and my parents came down for the race!!
And the weather and race were awesome, it was right in the downtown, set
up awesome, and I got four free hamburgers lol, as well as a few free
ones for my dad and mom! It was great to see them again after so long :)</p>
<p>The cycling team's hotel was pretty sketchy, (6 people per small,
smelly-ish room), and I opted to stay with my parents tonight after
having Zach cuddle with me and snore like a freight train 6 inches from
my face haha, got one of the worst nights sleep in a long time haha.
 Much improved haha in a Hilton that is HUGE and my own bed.  We got
dinner tonight, and it was really good, and we caught up on all that
we've been up to.</p>
<p>With my evident lack of training and/or fitness, I'm just going to relax
in the road race tomorrow and not try anything crazy (other than to
finish!).  Congrats to <a href="http://bigwatts.blogspot.com">Reid</a>, Matt
Dockins, and Ben Rice for strong finishes in the A, B and C fields
respectively!</p>
