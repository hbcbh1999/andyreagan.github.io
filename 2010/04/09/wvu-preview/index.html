    <p>So this weekend I will be travelling to West Virginia University to race
bikes.  Last year, they were two of my most successful races, despite
being the longest and hilliest road race of the season.</p>
<p>This year there is no time trial, just a criterium on Saturday and road
race on Sunday! Here is a link to their
<a href="http://www.wvucycling.com/Flyers/2010rrwvu.pdf">flyer.</a></p>
<p>I'm super excited for this weekend, I haven't raced in well over a
month.</p>
<h4>Worried...</h4>
<p>Well, since William and Mary and the crash, I wasn't able to ride my
bike very well for like 3 weeks.  I have been doing some training, but
Wednesday I went out and bonked hard on a ride that wasn't super hard.
 I don't think I'm in great shape...and so it's gonna hurt haha.  I'm
still optimistic, but am lowering my expectations of winning haha.</p>
<h4>But still excited, because</h4>
<p>even though I don't expect to ride very fast (or place) my parents and
Jean are going to be there! My parents are coming to see me race and to
switch cars...I'll be driving the Subaru out there but driving my good
ol' Accord back.  I missed the stickshift.  They're also bringing a lot
of stuff down, which should be good....I wish my speakers would fit in
the dorm room but I don't think they're going to.</p>
<h4>Other exciting news!</h4>
<p>I've failed to update the blog every day already for the month (7/9 days
now haha)...that's really hard to do though, BUT as of yesterday morning
the <em><strong>VT CYCLING CLOTHES WERE
DONE!</strong><span style="font-style:normal;">It'll take them a week to ship,
and all 17 crates are coming to the 7th floor of Lee Hall via UPS! Poor
delivery guy haha....the only thing I'm worried about is that they may
need customs payment to deliver the order, which is 12% of the invoice
total (\$22k).</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-style:normal;">I'm sure there's more, but that's all
you get for now haha. Thanks for reading.</span></em></p>
