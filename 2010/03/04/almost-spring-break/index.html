    <p>It's Wed night and that means I've only got one day left before break,
since I don't have any class Friday! I'm really excited for break to get
here, because I need a break for sure, but it's also hard to believe
that I'm already done with half of the semester (7 of 14 weeks down).</p>
<p>This break I'll be staying in Blacksburg, and teaching Math at East
Montgomery High School as a Noyce Scholarship Intern! I'm definitely
considering a career in teaching, not sure about high school but who
knows, I think it would be a pretty sweet job. Teach, and run a bike
shop haha.</p>
<p>The week was good, and busy, but is not quite over. Tomorrow I have
stuff due for SynTech, a paper in ES, and have a Mass and Energy
Balances test at 7PM. Right now, I'm procrastinating finishing/preparing
for all of these things haha. I also have a web development meeting for
Newman, but probably won't make that because it's at 6PM before my test.</p>
<p>And then Fri I don't have any class, and will be going to Lauren's house
for the weekend, to race at William and Mary. Works out really well
being the first weekend of spring break both this year and last. The
races are the same as last year, an ITT on Saturday with start times at
10AM (which means I'm probably close to 11) and a road race on Sunday,
and I go off at 11:05AM. Other plans for the weekend include Lauren
showing me stuff around town I'm sure, and going shopping for clothes
for teaching the coming week.</p>
<p>That infrared spectroscopy pre-lab is calling my name...</p>
