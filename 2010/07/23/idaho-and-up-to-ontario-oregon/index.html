    <p>I first apologize for the lack of updates, I'm loving the west and
frankly, blogging has moved down my list haha with the beauty of the
country and realization that my days with my awesome Bike and Build
group are numbered.</p>
<p>As a state, I really enjoyed Idaho and just today we passed into Oregon.
 My most recent tweet was incorrect though, because there is one county
in Oregon that is still on Mountain Time...and that's the one we came
into haha.  Tomorrow we will enter Pacific Time as we bike to Unity, OR.</p>
<p>Here's what has happened since my last blog:</p>
<p>07/14 Idaho Falls - ID 85<br>
07/15 BUILD DAY<br>
07/16 Arco - ID 72<br>
07/17 Challis - ID 62<br>
07/18 Stanley - ID 62<br>
07/19 Idaho City - ID 90<br>
07/20 Boise - ID 38<br>
07/21 DAY OFF<br>
07/22 Ontario - OR 52</p>
<p>I suppose I'll try to write a little about each!</p>
<p><strong>Idaho Falls</strong></p>
<p>Leaving Jackson, we climbed over Teton Mtn Pass, and Pine Creek Pass,
making for a hard day into Idaho Falls.  Over Teton pass, we took the
"old highway" which was the original Oregon Trail, was the highway, and
has since been converted to a bike-only path.  It takes a very direct
route up the mountain, with grade approaching 14% at it's steepest.  The
newer highway takes a nice sweeping 10% grade up the side of mountain,
of which I was a little jealous going up.  I pushed hard up the climb,
and so did everyone I'm pretty sure because there was no other way up
haha.  At the top, we could hear the first people up cheering from a
half mile away, and we had a big celebration at the top with an arm
tunnel, lots of dancing, and the haka.  On the descent, perhaps for our
own good, Mark and I got stuck behind traffic which was frustrating to
get on the brakes when we could've had our best chance at 60mph.  At the
bottom, the whole group stopped and we got world famous (presidents
pictures on the walls) huckleberry milkshakes in the teton valley.  They
were great.  The second pass was very gradual and little longer, easy to
cruise up.  Idaho Falls wasn't a great town to bike into by any means,
it had that strip-mall feel, but the awesomeness of our host made up for
that for sure.  We were greeted with food, cold water, showers,
conversation...and that was great.  They provided us with dinner that
night as well.  The four beard-off participants, including myself,
entered the final stage of the competition by grooming the beards into
some pretty awesome styles that night.</p>

<p>And I have lots of pictures of the beards...I'll save those for later

<p><strong>Build Day in Idaho Falls</strong></p>
<p>We worked with the local Habitat for Humanity, which is getting larger
and to aid in their expansion goal of building more than one house a
year to aid affordable housing in Idaho Falls, they are focusing on
expanding the ReStore as a source of funding.  We spent the day fixing
up the new building that they acquired, which was a VAST improvement to
the current one.  There was a TV crew there (I don't know the link to
the video) but we got to watch ourselves on the news later that night
which was cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/0401.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/0401-300x200.jpg" title="040"></a></p>

<p>For dinner, the pastor had us over to his house for a cookout.  He had
the best set up for a cookout I think I've ever seen...it was perfect
with a patio, huge grills and serving places, and it was an awesome
meal.  I think I ate three burgers haha.  And when we were walking
through his garage to leave, and gawking at his PERFECTly mint 1965
Mustang, he gave Mark, Dave, Jesse and I a ride back to the church in
it! The only modification is a hookup for his mp3 player, which he
filled with 60's music and leaves in the car.  That was awesome.  And
below that, I got the YAWYD stem caps in the mail from my parents!!</p>

<p><strong>Arco</strong></p>
<p>The town is famous as the first to be lit by atomic energy, and oh boy
do they pride themselves on that.  We came in to catch the first night
of their annual Atomic Days celebration.  On the way there, we passed
and took a tour of EBR-1, the first power-generating nuclear reactor in
the world.  The whole day biking was through desert, and some buttes,
and is where the Idaho National Laboratory is located where they do all
the nations nuclear research (over 50 test reactors or something).
 That's where most everyone in Arco and Idaho Falls work.  Coming into
town, we stopped our third pickle joint on the trip, this one being the
"Pickle Place" for atomic burgers.  They made their own seasoning, and
the beef was local somehow, one of the best burgers I've had on the
trip.  Also their high school, Butte, were the pirates.  Their sign read
"Home of the Butte Pirates" hahaha.</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ebr1.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ebr1-300x200.jpg" title="ebr1"></a></p>
<p><strong>Challis</strong></p>
<p>It was another long day through the desert to Challis, with roads that
disappeared into the horizon.  The whole day we battled massive
headwind, with one gradual climb and a great descent.  By far the
coolest part of the day was the Grand View Canyon that we passed
through.  Approaching the canyon it looked like we were going to run
straight into a mountain, but actually descended through it and the
views were <em>epic.</em>We stayed four miles outside of town, up a big hill,
and they Living Waters Retreat Center which was like an Oasis in the
desert.  Before climbing up there, Mark and I waited for Zach and got
some good calzones in town.  When we got there, next to the stream, I
pitched my hammock and took one of the best naps ever.</p>

<p><strong>Stanley</strong></p>
<p>It was Kristen's 21st birthday, and we were on sweep together! After
stopping at a diner in town and singing happy birthday to her, and
Alyson who's birthday it also was (although she got slightly
overshadowed bc it was Kristen's 21st haha) with everyone at the diner
helping and two candles in two pieces of pie.  It turned out being one
of my very favorite days of riding, although slow we made it a lot of
fun and it was hard not to have fun on her birthday haha.  We spend
almost the whole day going into a headwind, uphill beside an awesome
river, the Salmon River.  It's become an attraction for rafters
recently, although the only thing going on there back in the day was a
silver mine about half way there.  It was in a nowhere town of 29
people, and had a really cool museum that we spent some time at.</p>

<p>The scenery changed from desert river to pine forest river, which was
awesome to go through, and it was just really beautiful riding.  10
miles out from town, we stopped at a hot spring that went into the river
and that felt great.  It was long day for only 62 miles when we got into
town at 4:45PM, but neither of us minded.  Perhaps the best moment of
the day, maybe the week or even the whole trip, was turning one of the
many corners through the valley next to the Salmon River we had been
climbing all day, to see the landscape open before us to the skyline of
the Sawtooth Wilderness Mtns.  Stanley claims that is has the best mtn
vista in the west...and they may be just right.  To top it off, we
camped out on the side of town close to the mountains, the only thing
between them and us was a field and some trees.  I slept in the hammock,
and the stars were out of this world as well.</p>

<p>Later we would find out that that night, the coldest place in the
<em>entire US</em> was Stanley, ID.  I had slept in just my fleece blanket off
the ground in a hammock, and it was 34F when we woke up.  I couldn't
feel my feet.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, I hopped on my bike early that morning and
got an early start to stay warm.  That put me in front of the group
where I stayed all day, missing both lunches but somehow finding the
stamina to make 91 miles, 90 degree heat, and a 12 mile mountain climb
on 40oz. of water and two clif bars.  I got to the host at noon, the
same time that sweep made it to the first lunch 30 miles in.  Mark got
there a couple hours later and I woke up from my passed-out nap, and ate
a ton of food haha.</p>

<p><strong>Boise</strong></p>
<p>I didn't realize at the time, but putting myself out in front of the
group by so far was a poor choice in terms of safety, although I am a
strong rider....and for this, the leaders put me in the van for the day
into Boise.  So I didn't ride, but with a tailwind and mostly downhill
ride, Mark made it to town in less than two hours <em>including lunch</em>.  I
was really let down about not riding, and wrote some angry blog posts
that won't ever make it andyreagan.com, but after a while I got over
that...when we heard the news that really shook up our trip, and every
Bike and Build-er, past and present.</p>
<p>Paige Hicks, a leader on the P2S route, was struck by a truck and
killed.  I'm not going to elaborate, but you can read about her and the
full letter to the BnB community here:
<a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9188/1/">http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9188/1/</a></p>
<p>Our trip was very shaken up, as you can imagine, and we spent all night
in prayer and comforting each other.  We have learned how strong the
Bike and Build family truly is, which has been beyond amazing, and all
of thoughts and prayers go out to her family and the riders she led.  We
took a video the following day, along with many other things we have
done, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98hge31D82U">Bike and Build
IS</a>.  We'll be sending
notebooks to her family and the trip, and are wearing tye-dye yarn to
symbolize that we now are riding on for her.</p>
<p><strong>Day Off</strong></p>
<p>Needless to say, many of us also spent the day off coping with this loss
as well.  I enjoyed the sleeping in, and spent most of the morning doing
things on the computer and planning the end of the trip with Mom.  After
that I walked around town for awhile, got a milkshake, and then came
back to make dinner for the fourth night in a row on dinner crew.
 Heather shared her recipe for her <em>award-winning</em>grilled cheese, which
won the Tilamook grilled cheese competition her first year in it.  They
were the best grilled cheese I've ever had, I think most of the group
shared that sentiment.</p>

<p><strong>Ontario, OREGON</strong></p>
<p>Sixty-two miles after a rest day is nothing for us now, and so today was
definitely an easier day.  My legs were sore, but after stretching at
mile 15 I was all good.  A lot of farms on the way here, including the
Idaho University's experimental ones which seemed...interesting.  We all
waited for everyone at the state line, and with the two people we had
met who were biking across the country for fun who were really cool, to
take a state line picture with everyone in our last state!</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/105.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/105-200x300.jpg" title="105"></a></p>
<p>Leaving the sign looked like a trainwreck though.  I forget again what
they're called, but these little thorns gave just about everyone on the
trip flat tires.  Mark, earlier, and flats in both tires at the same
time! Somehow I managed to luck out, I think the record was Emma with
three flats.  And then in town at McDonald's, Kristens tire did the
weirdest thing ever, it got like pimples haha hard to explain but really
crazy.  She managed to ride it to the host somehow before it got flat in
the parking lot though.</p>

<p>Dinner tonight was spaghetti and salad, which was good and since then
I've had time to talk to Lauren for a long time for the second night in
a row which has been really nice.  Also got to take out and fix
Raleigh's fork, read some of a book, and now blog! Although I've only
got three hours to sleep...but I'm sure there will be more time to sleep
when I'm not biking across the country.</p>
<p>84 miles tomorrow to Unity, thanks for reading!</p>
