    <p>After a successful book hunt on Thursday night, I cleaned up the house
Friday morning and then headed down to Carrboro after brewing class on
Friday.  It was great to see Laura and Raleigh again, and on Saturday we
went on an amazing bike ride into the cackalacky countryside.</p>

<p>We rode around campus and Chapel Hill which was cool to see.  It's
another beautiful campus.  In NC, they are about two weeks behind
Blacksburg, with many of the leaves still on the trees.  We stopped and
laid in the arboretum, it was great.</p>
<p>Then we headed out to the countryside, and rode to the country store at
a dairy farm for fresh homemade ice cream and milk!! It was soooo good.
 I had a scoop of maple and of vanilla, in a homemade waffle cone, YUM.
 And I couldn't pass up the half gallon of chocolate milk, so I got it
in a grocery bag, and put my arms through the sleeves to ride home with
it!</p>
<p>We went out further for some more miles, and I saw a familiar jersey
heading the other direction, a Bike and Build jersey! Adam had done a
trip before, and knew Ral and Laura, and turns out he's going to be
living next to them next year.  He rode with us, and I pushed on the
pedals a little bit on a few rollers with him, those are the bigger
efforts below.</p>

<p>For dinner that night, we made a grocery store run and made pizza from
scratch.</p>

<p>I had to leave early Sunday, and headed up to Roanoke to pick up my Mom
from the airport! It's a nice drive, with some winding country climbs
and descents that made me want to get the bike outta the back seat.  The
timing worked out perfect, and I got to the airport just after she got
her baggage, and I could only hope Dave and James had left the house
clean.</p>
<p>They did, and my Mom approved of our house this year.  It was really
warm out, and to take advantage of the weather we hopped right on bikes
and set out to ride around campus and to Christiansburg on the
Huckleberry trail.</p>

<p>After \~16 miles of riding, we were back in town and Mom treated me to
Cabo Fish Taco for dinner, and a seasonal stout from Highlands Brewery
to top it off.  We decided that night to go on a hike the next day, the
two I knew of being Dragon's Tooth and McAfee's knob.  After poking
around online, we read that McAfee's was the single most photographed
spot on the whole AT and it was an easy choice.</p>
<p>I decided to bike out, and it was such a gorgeous day...</p>

<p>The hike was great, and the view INCREDIBLE.  SW VA is gorgeous.  From
the top you can see all the way around, even into Roanoke Valley and see
the city nestled in the valley.  Pictures do little justice, but here
are a handful:</p>

<p>We came back and went to Bull and Bones for dinner, which turned out to
be a perfect choice.  Head basketball coach Seth Greenberg was on the
radio live when we got there, and after we finished eating went over to
see Frank Beamer talk.  Everything was great: the brewhaus chili, cheesy
mac n cheese, bbq beans, pulled pork with all four sauces, the IPA and
the stout.</p>
<p>That night Kati came over and we all watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078902/">Breaking
Away</a> streamed via netflix through
the xbox, and it was a really good movie.  Thanks to <a href="http://mydailyground.com">Brett
Sherfy</a> for the tip that it was on netflix
streaming.</p>
<p>Tuesday we took the opportunity to sleep in, and I went for a ride with
Bill while Mom went for a run around campus.  We headed out to the
river, but the rain hit earlier than predicted and we got soaked.
 Luckily, Bill was prepared enough for the both of us and let me borrow
his rain jacket, it was a huge life saver because I was comfy with just
a jersey to start, but once I got wet the wind made it so cold.  We rode
real hard, here's a lookski:</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/11_23_10_power.png"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/11_23_10_power-300x148.png" title="11_23_10_power"></a>For
dinner, we ate some of the many pounds of cooked pasta in the fridge,
and it was good after sitting in sauce for a few days.  Then Kati came
over with some of the pumpkin brew and we all hung out for awhile.</p>
<p>Wednesday, Mom and I again took advantage of our vacation, and slept in.
 It was still rainy, and I didn't feel like riding because I was a
little sore still, and so we went for a 5 mile run together.  My calves
were real tight, and we stopped at one point so I could stretch.  The
run was also hillier than my Mom is used to, it's impossible to run
without going up or downhill nearly the whole time in Blacksburg.  From
the top of Clay St, we took a right into some development, and there
were so awesome views of Ellett valley.</p>
<p>After our run, we didn't waste much time and I loaded up my bike to
bring to WV.  The drive to Jean's house went well, without any stops.
 Not long after, Kyle and Dad got here and we were all back together for
the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
