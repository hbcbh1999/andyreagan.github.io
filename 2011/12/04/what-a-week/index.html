    <p>The first week back from Thanksgiving Break was excellent, and although
was buried in the books for most of the day, I was able to get out
pretty much every night. First for the cycling meeting and to play
basketball with Professor Norton on Mon night, to the tri meeting on
Tuesday night, the TruGold Roller races Wed night, the Betty Crocker
Cookoff on Thurs night, then the Biro D'Italia on Fri night , the Putnam
Competition and race some Cyclocross Saturday!</p>
<p>Woo! Well it's back to books again on Sunday, so perhaps I'll write more
about these events later. (If I do, it'll be appended below).</p>
<p><strong>TruGold Racing</strong></p>
<p>Scotland Leman is a professor at Virginia Tech who used to race bikes,
and is now getting back into racing and very involved with helping out
the team. This includes an awesome series of roller races that he's put
together, under the name "TruGold." Basically, we gather in a room in
Randolph Hall, and torch our legs on some rollers with head to hear
races! Here's a video to better explain:</p>

<p>This past Wednesday's races were highlighted by a bike domino crash, and
a heck of  a lot of racing. Jacob Aber pushes the line between going
fast and staying on the rollers to the going fast side, and in his first
race he came off the rollers. He fell into Naik who was on his right,
who fell over. I was so distracted by all of the crashing that I didn't
pay attention to the fact that I was riding on rollers, and looked down
to realize I was no longer on mine. I fell right into Mike, who was on
rollers, who fell right into Justin, also on rollers. It must have been
pretty hilarious to watch, by the end half of the room was on the ground
tangled in bikes. I felt bad to knocking Mike and Justin over, but no
bikes (or people) were damaged so it was all good, I suppose. There were
a few more falls in the night, resulting one busted tire (Zach), Jacob
later broke his shifter, and broke the cable on one of the rollers.</p>
<p>The racing consisted of two double elimination events, the 500m (scary
fast) and 2km distances. The 500m was scary because was a sprint, on
rollers. Scotland (the fastest) was seeing speeds in the mid 40's <em>on
rollers</em>. And these aren't just any rollers, they're TruTrainers. Super
nice rollers. They have resistance, and a flywheel that allows you to
coast. The coasting is really cool, and even more like real road riding
than any other roller out there, but there is nothing less that I want
to do than coast without slowing at 40MPH after a 30sec sprint. The 2k
races were more reasonable, as I was only holding close to 30 (although
Scotland held 36MPH for the 2k). I was happy to get Mike and John G in
my first 2k race, but after that my legs were pretty cooked. We races
from 7PM-11:30PM, and I took a ride home from John G which was much
appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Betty Crocker Cookoff</strong></p>
<p>Aaron Bradner hosted a tri team potluck, this time themed as a cookoff!
There was a category for deserts, and as it turned out, everyone made
deserts. Which is certainly not a problem. I made my Mom's PB No-bake
cookies, and now realize why my Dad can't eat them anymore but boy are
the delicious. But they're all sugar, butter, and cream haha. Guess I
just better keep up the running.</p>

<p><strong>Research Group Final Presentations</strong></p>
<p>Friday afternoon our research group under Reinhard Laubenbacher gathered
for our end of semester meeting, and this time our assignment was to
prepare and present a <em>concrete</em> five-year plan. I wore a button down
every day this week it felt like, and Friday I went one higher with the
suit! I volunteered to present first, and having put a lot of thought
and effort into this very difficult assignment, was very happy how it
went. It was perhaps the first time I've presented with Reinhard in the
room that I felt like I had prepared 100% and was on task; perhaps
that's a sign that I'm maturing in my presentation abilities. Without
the actual presentation, I don't think that these two slides mean too
much, but here they are: <a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Andy-5-Year-Plan.pdf">Andy 5 Year
Plan</a></p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Laubenbacher-research-group-Fall-2011.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Laubenbacher-research-group-Fall-2011-1024x768.jpg" title="Laubenbacher research group Fall 2011"></a></p>
<p><strong>Biro D'Italia</strong></p>
<p>I was only able to stay at Reinhard's after meeting happy hour for about
half an hour (<a href="http://connect.garmin.com/dashboard?cid=2012064">after biking up Brush Mtn with
Jason</a> to get there),
and was headed back home for the BIRO D'ITALIA. The brain child of
Bradner and I, as an addition to the tours of Blacksburg's already
famous Tour de Franzia, it came together beautifully. I was still
figuring out where the stops were during that day, and we had a changed
of route approx 5min before the race began, but dang it was actually
pretty smooth. First, check out this awesome flyer (yes I spent an hour
on this, but consider that I don't have TV):</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/biro2.png"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/biro2-1024x640.png" title="biro2"></a></p>
<p>The route was all together about 12 miles, and the way we decided to run
it was a group ride (staying together, although riding quick) out to the
Foxridge stop. Then, it was race on. And it worked out perfect that way,
because we were able to have fun riding together, then lay the hammer
down on the last two stops. Racing at 25MPH for the final 6
miles, immediately after beverage 4, with beverage 5 in the middle, and
beverage 6 immediately after was pretty darn challenging. Really, my
stomach was just pretty full, trying to stay in the drops in the big
ring.</p>
<p>The three awards went as follows: with the first place finish, Andy
Wentzel donned the Maglia Rosa. A strong effort and smart choice of
route won the Aggresivo Maximo for Christian P as he was first to the
Martini Party, and the Intoxica Suprema awarded to Greg P for a tough
finish at Stage 6. The Intoxica was the toughest award to give out,
because also Jan G's carbonated beverage of choice was Brooklyn East
India Pale Ale, but he had no problems with this choice.</p>
<p>My finish was 3rd place, behind Bill Lucy and right ahead of Mike B.
David H rounded out the top 5. Somebody has a picture of the whole gang,
but I don't know if I'll be able to find it haha.</p>
<p>Here is the garmin race data (includes
stops): <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/132353786">http://connect.garmin.com/activity/132353786</a></p>

<p><strong>Putnam Competition</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/should-you-get-wasted-the-night-before-a-big">studies have
shown</a>,
I was really at no disadvantage on the Putnam after the Biro D'Italia.
However, if each of the Grand Tours happened every semester (which they
don't), I would be<a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/did-all-that-drinking-you-did-in-college-real">in
trouble</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't know what the Putnam is, I can't really summarize it better
than
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>During the exam, it became clear why one correct answer (of 12) would
land a taker in the top 28%. It's tricky. I submitted 7 answers,
although I'm fairly certain that I over-simplified two of them. So, I'd
be pretty happy with the median score of 1 really, but I hope to have
done better. Had I been smarter and focused on two problems per 3-hour
session, I probably would have gotten a higher score, but had less fun.
(Because there's almost no partial credit).</p>
<p><strong>Tech Cross</strong></p>
<p>At the same venue (same event) as my first event with the cycling team,
I headed over to the cross races after the Putnam. I brought my shoes,
jersey, shorts, and helmet just in case, but didn't really plan on
racing since I didn't have a cross bike. Jaber was nice enough to let me
borrow his nice Felt cross bike though, and not more than 15 minutes
after being in a windowless room for 6 hours doing hard math problems, I
was willing pain into my legs whilst riding a confused road mountain
bike child around in laps. I didn't want to mess Jaber's fit, so I
didn't move his seat up, and I'm pretty sure that riding a seat 4 inches
too low didn't help me put down too much extra power. I still rode as
hard as I could, and finished like 7th? It would've been nice to be able
to open it up on the flats with a full leg extension, but it was still a
bunch of fun, and I didn't break Jacob's bike (although I did get some
sweet air on it, don't tell him).</p>
<p>Well, suppose that's all for now actually.</p>
