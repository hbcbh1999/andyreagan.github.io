    <p>I had an amazing time this past weekend racing at WVU with the team. The
races went well, and it was great talking and hanging out in the
beautiful weather, and great atmosphere the whole time.  And I'm
currently procrastinating real life (some homework) to write about how
much fun I had.</p>

<h4>Friday: HW, Test, then driving!</h4>
<p>I had a tough week of schoolwork, among other things school-related
(applying to grad school...the usual) and finished up Friday.  First,
with turning in my Number Theory problem set on which I was able to
figure out the two really hard problems and finish up my C++ program in
the morning.  And I took my second exam in Advanced Calculus, which I
think went pretty well.  I studied for it as much as I though was
reasonable, which probably amount to two or so hours...because all there
really is to do studying is memorize definitions (4 pages of them) which
I know by now already, and go over the homework.</p>
<p>Jumping back in time to Thursday, I had a C++ exam and I'm pretty sure I
crushed it.  I was disappointed with my performance on the first test,
probably because I didn't really study and the questions were just picky
about the syntax.  But now that we're into more complicated programming,
I like it better.  Last time I didn't do any of the Koofers, but this
time I did three of them and it was getting pretty repetitive.  On
Tuesdays and Thursdays this semester I have been eating with the Tri
team for lunch at D2, but they were on their way to Nationals in Alabama
already so it was just Andy W and I.  Just saw Grayson in the parking
lot as we got back from the races, and it sounded like they did really
well, 8th overall, so congrats to them!  So my day Thursday was like:
wake up, C++ koofer, Num Anal class, lunch, study C++ for three hours
and work on a prime number program, C++ test, then coding for another
two hours before I gave it up and went to PK's for dinner with the
cycling team guys.  One of the problems for number theory was to write a
program to determine whether a given really really large number was
prime.  I would do it in MATLAB, but it can only factor numbers up to
2\^32 (even though I'm running the 64 bit version) so I tried to learn
Mathematica which can factor numbers that big.  But programming in
Mathematica is super confusing, and totally unlike any other language.
 It's stupid.  So I resorted to C++, and the program I wrote was like
400 lines of code, and there is still more I need to add to make it work
fully.  A lot of that is a function that factors big numbers, then
another one that takes bases to giant exponents in binary...and you
don't care anymore.</p>
<p>I was going to attempt an easy ride Friday, but didn't get a chance to
before I needed to pack up, and have time to submit my beer for
competition before leaving at 4.  I submitted my IPA with just cascade
hops that Will and I brewed under "American IPA" and my Raison D'Etre
clone under "Belgian Dubbel" and I think that my belgian has a good shot
at it.  The IPA...I'm just hoping that it's at least carbonated by the
time they judge them.</p>
<p>The drive to WV is long, but we split it half and half (2.5 hrs each)
with a stop at Pies and Pints, an awesome pizza place in Fayetteville,
WV.  The black bean pizza that Jacob and I split was delicious, but
Rogue's Chateau beer was an imperial porter, but too harsh on the
roastedness.  The chocolate malt made it taste really burnt. Oh well on
that.  At the hotel for the night we hung out, and drank some Yuenglings
before calling it a night.</p>
<h4>Saturday: Double Criterium</h4>
<p>The criterium course in downtown Clarksburg is an awesome venue, with
the race going around two city blocks in the middle of downtown.  The
mayor loves having us out, and there are all sorts of activities with a
kids race, people in costumes, and a cop on 10 foot stilts was walking
around.  I even saw the mayor, who came up and introduced herself to all
of us, riding around on a trike in the open area in the middle of the
course where the kids stuff was going on too.</p>

<p>We didn't have anyone in the first race, Men's D, but there were five of
us ready to get Andy W the win in the Men's C.  The race was 30 min, and
it was a fast race, mostly due to Jake.  He was up front most of the
race, put in two attacks, and made us all work.  I attacked at some
point, and got off the front, but App State weren't the ones chasing me
so I eased off.  Coming down to the last lap, Andy W and I were not in
great position at all.  He got on my wheel into the last lap, and as we
came around the start/finish I drilled it with him behind me and we got
up near the front into turn one.  I pulled at something like 1200W, and
on that stretch blew myself up.  Coming out of turn 2 into the slight
uphill, I was cooked and wasn't able to communicate that to Andy who
stayed behind me for too long.  App went around me to the left, and Andy
was left to chase them into the last two corners, and to the finish
line.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have gone too hard on that first pull,
and saved enough to give Andy a real lead out, or at least let him know
that I was dead.  So I pretty much screwed the pooch on that one...and
it was a frustrating finish.  I think Andy got like 4th or something,
but he needs wins to move up.</p>

<p>After the collegiate races, there were also USAC category races going
on.  By USAC races, I just mean non-collegiate races.  Technically our
collegiate races are part of USAC, but we race in the collegiate
categories of A through D.  That's unique to collegiate, and all the
other races across the country have categories 1 through 5. And pro,
which is above 1 I guess. But 1's and A's are the fastest, and down from
there.</p>

<p>On my license, I'm still a cat 5 (beginner), and so Jake, Christian and
I decided to race the cat 5 race.  The guy from WVU organizing the races
offered the collegiate guys a discount to \$15 for a second race of the
day, which was cool.  The race was 30min, same length as Men's C.  It
ended up being mostly a collegiate rematch too.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2220" align="aligncenter" width="300"

<p>There were three prime laps (pronounced preem), which are laps in which
the first person wins something.  In collegiate, every race that I've
done for that matter, the primes are for more points.  Which is
exciting, but not really.  Perhaps the coolest part of real racing is
that there are real prizes.  So for the primes, the prizes were a
sausage, tshirt, and hat for the first one, a water bottle and cage for
the second, and I don't even remember what the third was.  I just
remember hearing them, and thinking that first one was pretty sweet, and
I wanted it.  The other races earlier had growlers from Mountain State
Brewing, but we're just cat 5 I guess.  Those were half the reason I
signed up.</p>

<p>From the gun, we hit it real hard.  By we, I mean Christian and Jake on
the front of the race.  I felt bad that we were going so hard in the
beginner category, it was definitely not a beginner pace.  I was on the
back for the first 15 minutes, and then started to move up.  Within a
few laps, we were already lapping people, whoops.  I was waiting on the
first prime, and when I heard the bell I got up to about 5th wheel.
 Coming into the finish, there is a hard turn into a short steep uphill,
then a dowhill to the finish line.  Out of that last corner I was
something like 6th, and got on it.  As I crested the hill and looked
down at the start/finish, I was really far back from the first guy, with
quite a few people in the way, but I sprinted with everything I had and
weaved through them.  The first guy was still a bike length ahead of me
with 50 feet to go and I was sprinting hard, and right at the line I
threw my forward and jusssst put my front wheel ahead of his. Victory!
 That was the best sprint I think that I've ever put in race, maybe, I
made up serious ground and pimped that guy hard.</p>
<p>I was cooked from that sprint, and luckily had gotten far enough ahead
that I could relax without anyone attacking on the next lap.  I just
hung in until the finish really, going for the second prime (think I got
second) but I wasn't going to burn my last match.  They put the last
prime with two laps to go...which meant that the next lap was going to
be fast for the prime, and then it was the last lap!  I hated it when
they did that to us last time.  But I knew enough not to sprint too hard
for that last prime so I could stay on the final lap, and didn't go for
the prime.  Luckily no one else went for too hard either, and we were
mostly together after it going into the last lap.  Into the fast
downhill turn 3, Jake A was first wheel and crushed the hard corner,
opening up a gap on second.  I was like 4 or 5th or something at this
point, and coming uphill out of the last corner was talking to myself.
 This is the last sprint Andy, give it everything you've got.  So I sat
on Jake's little train, and he was drilling it so no one was about to
come around.  In reality, it was a perfect leadout.  I came off of his
wheel sprinting, but didn't want to nab my own teammate at the line so I
think I held back a little, although I'm not even sure that I had more
anyway.  Jake crushed it all the way through the finish for the win,
which was sweet.  I flew around to the right for 3rd, which I was
totally happy with.</p>
<p>I did end up getting my sausage prime, and some pretty sweet socks and a
tshirt.  And for 3rd, I got \$15, which covered my entry fee, sweet!
Jake got \$35, which was awesome for him, he was working so hard the
whole race.  And I totally couldn't have won either the prime, or come
in third without being able to sit in the group while Christian was
working hard up front, so a big kudos to him as well.</p>
<p>Doing well in the race put me in a great mood, and we other really
strong performances on the day as well.  Everyone was happy, it was a
good day of racing.  I'll write about those other performances on the
cycling website, maybe.  Getting dinner was an adventure, it's freakin
tough making a decision with 15 people, but we eventually ended up at a
Chinese buffet which was good enough.  We were all tired, but chilled
until midnight before going to bed, talkin about girls and of course,
bikes.</p>
<h4>Sunday: Road Race</h4>
<p>I'm out of time a little, I shall write later about the road race.
 Ciao!</p>
