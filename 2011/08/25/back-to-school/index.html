<p>I've been back for nearing a week now, and I just love it down here in
BBurg with the town and how accessible everything is and the mountains.
Seeing friends from cycling and tri that I hadn't all summer was
awesome.  I've even had a chance to work on, and finish the tall bike
that Alex Brown and I started this summer. Riding that thing around
campus (it's literally one bike frame welded onto the top of a full
bike) I have gotten some fun comments, mostly like "woah that's the
coolest bike ever." I am 6 feet tall, and the bike is 6 feet in the air.
I'll post of video of my sweet mounting technique  in due time.</p>
<p>Classes are going to pick up soon, I know it, so while I have time I'm
excited to go this weekend and pick up my finished CHRIS KING R45
WHEELS! They're done today (Thursday) and they're gonna be soooo nice.
Best bday present.  Also I got all of my stuff shipped down that I left
at home, namely my running shorts.</p>
<p>That's all for now, here's a quick breakdown of my classload this
semester (an excuse to not post for the next three months):</p>
<ul>
<li>MATH 4225 Real Analysis: touted to be hardest undergraduate course
    at Tech, I get what follows in an email this summer, and then Dr.
    Rossi finds it necessary to read out loud at the beginning of class
    Monday: "The word “elementary” in the title of the course is not a
    commentary on the difficulty of this course but rather it is the
    traditional nomenclature that differentiates the topics of  this
    course from a graduate level course in Real Analysis which involves
    Lebesgue measure and integration. In my opinion Math 4225 is the
    most difficult undergraduate math course that we offer. If you have
    never taken advanced calculus (Math 3225) or did poorly in that
    class or you have always had a difficult time with “proofs”, you may
    find another math class more appropriate."</li>
<li>MATH 4124 Abstract Algebra: this shit's so abstract it's in the
    title! I was warned to say as far away from this class as possible
    by a friend Jason on the tri team, but Dr. Brown is teaching it and
    he's awesome, I've had him for a few others and I think he likes me
    (not that that helps though).</li>
<li>MATH 5515 Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems: seems so far
    to be an ODE class, but good that I have a biking friend from VBI in
    the class. But it's still a grad class. We shall see.</li>
<li>MATH 4... History of Mathematics: Taking it P/F, because I was to
    take it and think that it's going to be super interesting. The
    teacher is Dr Andy Norton, and I really like him a lot, but I've
    heard the class is a lot of work.</li>
<li>MATH 4445 Numerical Analysis: the first semester of the Numerical
    Analysis sequence shouldn't be a killer, but it ain't easy and we're
    going to be doing a lot of programming. Dr Boorgard *spelling is
    teaching it, and I like him a lot too, so should be okay.</li>
<li>World Regions: possibly the largest college class ever, Dr John
    Boyer (JB, Boyer, the Plaid Avenger, J-Bizzler, The Professor...this
    guy's a celebrity) finds it as his calling to educate our generation
    on what's going on the world now, because it does all affect us, and
    it's important that we understand how our decisions affect the
    world. the class seems awesome so far, and is the same one that I
    took part in a stunt in as part of our Spartan Army. I'm only taking
    it as an audit</li>
</ul>
<p>So maybe some themes that I've picked up on, a couple classes are killer
and the others are hard, but they'll all add up and I might become a
math-nerd-hermit. But I doubt that. Talking about them, I knew all of
the professors, and all but two knew who I was when I walked in the
door, which is pretty awesome. Kk, really gotta run now (literally, 12
miles today!).</p>
