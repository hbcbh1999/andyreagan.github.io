    <p>The same day as the aforementioned Draper Mile marked the conclusion of
the MSSB REU which was my job for the summer, and I miss everyone in the
program but am excited as well for the opportunity to continue this
research.  I took the two weeks I had at the end of summer, and went
home.  This year for the Great Race, my Mom was the captain of Team
Reagan, and we recorded the best race I've ever been in, by nearly 7
minutes.  Now I'm back at school, and have 20 minutes to burn before a
class so here goes.</p>
<h4>REU Conclusions</h4>
<p>This past summer, if you hadn't heard, I spent doing mathematical
biology researching at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, located on
Virginia Tech campus.  The program was a Research Experience for
Undergraduates, specifically in Modeling and Simulation of Systems
Biology and was sponsored by the NSF. Thank them.</p>
<p>I got to work with Dr. Julia Chifman as a mentor, who obtained her Ph.D
in Math from University of Kentucky, now at the Mathematical Biosciences
Institute and the work was done under our program director, Dr. Reinhard
Laubenbacher of VBI and VT.  On my team was Jim Brunner (UMich), Paul
Vines (Roanoke), and Emily Hendryx (Angelo State).  Our team was
awesome, and the research we did in making a discrete model of iron
metabolism was very well received by the biologists at the Wake Forest
Cancer Biology Department who study iron metabolism and cancer.</p>
<p>Spending 8hrs/day getting up close and personal with a discrete model, I
learned a great deal. Jim had greater experience coming in with ODE
models, which are in general much more popular, and towards the end of
our time got frustrated with the shortcoming of the discrete modeling
framework. This current semester I am taking a graduate class in
Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems that, from the looks of it
so far, will focus entirely on ODE's.  I am very interested to gain this
perspective.</p>
<p>I titled this conclusions, and so there are some that I can share. I
have made a decision to study applied mathematics in graduate school as
a result of this experience. Math can be very useful in giving us more
information about real systems, and this is what I want to do.  The
specific application of mathematics is something with which I am still
struggling, and am still hesistant about going into math biology
specifically. For one, biology isn't my favorite subject and doing
research in biology increased my level of frustration with the
understand we do have of biology.  There are many experiments that are
done, and we are able to elicit the functions of many protiens, but
there is still so much that is unsure.  Some of the other applications
of math that I find appealing are climate modeling and traffic
modeling.  These are both very real problems that face us, and they're
not isolated from each other. Looking at different schools and figuring
out which ones to apply to is actually quite difficult, and I sent my
GRE scores to VT, Boulder, Univ Maryland, and Univ of Minnesota.  One
professor who I have found specifically whose research sounds very
interesting is Dr. Chris Danforth at the Univ of Vermont:

<h4>Being Home</h4>
<p>After the program had concluded, with our final Research Symposium, I
came home pretty quick. The Draper Mile was that night, and I headed
home on Saturday. I got a late start, at something like 10:30 in the
morning so it made for a long day of driving but I made it home safe n
sound.</p>
<p>My two weeks at home were very much like a vacation, as both of my
recent trips home have been.  I lounge around, eat great food, ride and
run like that's my job, and go out downtown with my friends.  I ended up
playing more disc golf this break than I did going to dtown SYR, and it
was good.  The first Sunday I was back, Sam from Bport came and visited,
and her and Dan and I went and played a nice round of disc golf.
Unfortunately it was one of my few losses of the season (I ended the
summer series a half game down), but Sam was there so we could make fun
of how Dan looks like he's going to fall every time he throws ;).</p>
<p>Not much unlike coming home in the beginning of summer (whence I was
told that I had been signed up for a bike race and a 5K the coming
weekend), my Mom captained a team for the Great Race. I'm really glad
that she took the initiative, in making this my 7th consecutive great
race and with my broski Kyle paddling, we dropped 7min off our previous
best time.  Losing only by 30sec the year before, this year we were
second by 5min, as the other team in our age category had brought in a
ringer in the kayak that with a 18ft kevlar machine put 5 minutes into
Kyle.</p>
<p>It was also exciting to see that my Dad is getting back into great
shape, only 6 months after having a heart attack.  We got to go on some
great walks, and my Garmin Connect "Walk with @rumblinstumblin"
(classified as Speed Walking) will testify to this shape, 2 miles in
less than 30 min is a pretty mean pace.  And my Mom is in as good of
running shape as ever, and she came out and put the hurt on me a little
at the end of one of my longer runs, as I had to tell her to slow down
more than once!</p>
<p>One of the biggest things that happened while I was home was that my
parents bought lake property on Skan Lake, and it is awesome.  When my
Dad told me over the phone as I was driving home that he and Mom "found
some lake property they were going to put an offer on" all I could do
was chuckle because oh how many times I'd heard that. But they did it,
and are currently closing on 5 acres with shared access to a 280ft
lakefront. The property itself is wooded, and I love it. Would be a
perfect place to build a cabin. I'm less fond of my Dad's idea to buy a
10k pop-up and haul that thing in, but he's also looking at building a
garage-house that would be cool. Problem is that it all adds up with a
septic and well, and then up goes the assessment.  It's just hard to now
have the land, and not want to build on it.  But I think they'll be
patient.</p>
<p>I looked at my title again for the rest of what I was going to talk
about and saw great race, but I already talked about that. Perhaps some
other things to mention there are that my Mom suprised me again coming
in at just over 23 minutes.  My Garmin data puts me at winning a minute
with no transistion time, but with our high number (longer transisition)
and the volunteers making my brother walk that whole 1/4 mile, it took 3
minutes for just the handoffs and I had come in two minutes behind the
leader in 13th place.  And it was definitely the transisitions, because
on the course I caught up to two guys that were going hard enough that
it seemed they could stick with me after awhile.  This was after passing
roughly 100 people (I passed 120-some total), which is crazy. I'm almost
over the yellow line, laying down 24-ish MPH whizzing by, and
ocassionaly weaving through, a literal crowd of bikers to the right. 
The two guys could in fact hold my draft (do 30% less work than I was)
but after two miles of this, when we got to a hill, I wanted to let them
do some work and pull up. It's not even as much more work to be on the
front on the hill, but instead (feeling fresh from drafting off me for
so long), the one dude sprinted around me and the other followed him.
Like, really, what was he thinking? That I had caught him, pulled him
for 2 miles, and that now he was just going to leave me in the dust?
Annoyed, I reeled them back in, and sat on their draft for 15 seconds
before sprinting around them so they wouldn't have a chance to sit in my
draft. Recovering from my attack, one of them made their way up to me, a
guy from Skan who races for Notre Dame.  He was actually cool, and would
take a short pull when I asked him to.  His pulls were very short, and
19MPH instead of the 22 I was doing, but he was doing what he could. And
he wasn't a jerk and let me come into the transisition area first after
pulling hard into it (it was downhill going into it). But his time was a
minute faster than mine, when I know mine should've beaten his by at
least 30sec (I had to first catch him), so that little anecdote just
speaks to our transistions. But, we still wouldn't have been able to
catch the team in our category ahead of us. Luckily we bead the team the
guy that I helped was on, because they were actually in the same
category haha.</p>
<p>That's all for now!!</p>
