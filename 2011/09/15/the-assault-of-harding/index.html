<p>Comrades,</p>
<p>For too long have we cyclists of Virginia Tech and of the Blacksburg
community been held in fear of the climb known as Harding. Too long
has the sound of Harding Repeats stabbed pain into the legs and the
hearts of those we hold dear. Â Too many are the souls crushed as the
likes of DeLong, Gargiulo, and Crawford danced on their pedals whilst
us mere mortals are left to suffer.</p>
<p>To put an end to this tyranny under which we are being forced to live,
a militia is to be gathered at 5PM Thursday at the Pillars of Virginia
Tech with solitary purpose of defeating our great foe once and for
all. We shall flood the fields and take Harding with the watts of
champions. Our ascent over this beast will surely be strong and fast.</p>
<p>"This is where we fight! This is where [Harding] dies!"<br>
 Andy</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Battle Plan</span></p>
<p>Where: War Memorial Chapel</p>
<p>When: Thursday 5PM</p>
<p>What: Light warm-up with an all-out effort up Harding</p>
<p>Who: Everyone who wants to PR the climb!</p>
<p>Motivation:  </p>

<p>Today the militia was gathered, and with the likes of Justin C, Mike B,
Andy W, Will M, Tyler G, Robbie, Zach M, Cody we fought. And we
prevailed. It was windy and cold, but as a team we rode.</p>
<p>At the bottom, I sat behind Mike and Will. Will went off, but we reeled
him back in by the middle. Cody led Mike Will and I across the middle,
whench the three of us attacked the notch. Mike and Will crushed the
notch, Mike said he saw 770 watts lol. They had gapped me, and I chased
after them to the top, finishing in a personal record 10:19!! Two
minutes faster than I ever have before, I was happy with this effort.</p>
<p>When I first got the Kazane, I rode Harding all out to have a baseline.
Nearly two years ago, I was at 13:30.</p>
<p>Here's the Strava leaderboard:</p>
