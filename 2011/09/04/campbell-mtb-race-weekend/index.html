    <blockquote>
<p>Dear VT Cyclist,</p>
<p>I’m emailing you because there are serious, very serious, choices to
be made, and made immediately. On the 3rd of October of 2010, Virginia
Tech Cycling accomplished one of its greatest feats, Winning the ACCC
MTB Conference Championships.</p>
<p>Today, on the 2^nd^ of September of 2011, I officially lay before you
the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial ASU cycling team and
its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use
its every vessel to destroy the VT Cycling Team and Claim the ACCC MTB
Conference Title.</p>
<p>This announcement shows I am a concerned Alumnus. I fear for the
well-being of the VT Cycling, as I see the lack of participate in the
1^st^ MTB race of the season. I fear many of you have lost the
motivation, the feeling of what it is to be a Champion, and never
quenchable thirst for victory.</p>
<p>Though it is hard to fathom such a fear when VT Cycling is under such
great leadership and carries such great potential.</p>
<p>How can VT Cycling not succeed with:</p>
<p>Lil Jake Anderson traveling at light speed on his 29in wheels.</p>
<p>Andy Reagan providing his bearded man wisdom and enthusiasm about
every course.</p>
<p>Kay Comer making even the fastest men cry as she leaves them behind.</p>
<p>Jan G speaking in a language no one can understand while speeding by.</p>
<p>Cecil “The Legend” McAllister(enough said)</p>
<p>Brian Luster who’s so fast he had to take a year off school so
everyone else could catch up.</p>
<p>Andrew Roberson who does tailwhips over people in order to pass.</p>
<p>Andy Wentzel the greatest keep secret of VT cycling.</p>
<p>Christian Probst who is fast as **** and should be racing this
weekend.</p>
<p>And Of course World Class Coach JUSTIN MORRISON, a legend in his own
right.</p>
<p>I can only hope the preceding greats can win the ACCC title for us,
while the rest of you act like scared freshmen, or indulge in binge
“road soda” drinking, or attempt to talk to the opposite sex but then
realize you can’t, or all of the above.</p>
<p>The presence of the ASU Cycling Team is a warfare against mankind. It
is a war against the Hokie nation. The ASU Cycling team has the
strength, the numbers, the potential, and the willingness to defeat
the VT cycling team and claim the ACCC MTB title.</p>
<p>Each VT cyclist must decide for themselves how it will meet this
presence. The choice you make for yourselves must be made with a
moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our
character and our motives as a cyclist. Our motive will be revenge and
the victorious assertion of the physical might.</p>
<p>There is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we
will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred
rights of our team to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which
we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very
roots of human life.</p>
<p>Made the right choice!</p>
<p>Email Andy Wetzel(<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#65;&#114;&#119;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#122;&#64;&#118;&#116;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;">&#65;&#114;&#119;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#122;&#64;&#118;&#116;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>) and State the following:</p>
<p>I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Your Name)</span> will not
allow my team, my pride, or my country be subject to the evils of the
ASU Cycling Team. I will defend the honor of my team, myself and my
country. I will be attending the race this coming weekend at Campbell
and I will take whatever actions are necessary to make this happen
including pay my dues and fill out the release waiver / driver release
form found at the Rec Sports website.</p>

<p>Called into action by none other than Ben Warren, the VT Cycling MTB
Team headed to Campbell this weekend for an awesome weekend of racing
and fun.  The racing was good, some delicious road sodas were consumed,
and some people in particular laid it on the line for the team.</p>
<p>Short Track</p>
<p>Typically my favorite event, as it is the most friendly to strong legs
and less technical, I was still a little nervous for my first race in
Men's B. It's a lap race, with this one having about 3min laps and my
race was 30min long.  I started near the back, and there is a seriously
steep section for half of it, with one crazy steep kicker, and then a
flowy downhill, then up the hill all over again.  As I got to the crazy
steep part, someone had put a foot down and the whole group was falling
over and a mess. So what usually happens, the first few people to get to
it and clean it got a decent head start. I slowed up and passed some
people who were walking it by riding up, but still had to wait at the
top for people to get back on their bikes. On the downhill, the dude in
front of me slid out and rather than let me by, took up the whole trail
and I had to stop and wait while he got back on... so it wasn't a great
start, to say the least. On the uphill, since I could ride it, I passed
people for pretty much the whole rest of the race.  No idea what place I
was in with like 3 laps to go, I asked the guys on our team watching and
I had actually picked people off up to 4th place.  Unable to catch the
guys who had a huge head start most likely, I finished in fourth and was
really happy with that for my first B race.</p>
<p>Other than myself, Jake A finished 3rd in Men's A, Andy W took 3rd in my
race, Kay took 2nd in Women's A, and Bill Lucy got 3rd in the Men's C
race. Bill was winning the race by a good but, until he caught a hanging
vine with his neck, and it clotheslined him straight off the bike. He
somehow continued to ride and hang on for 3rd, pretty intense.</p>
<p>Downhill</p>
<p>The "downhill" race was a few hours later, and is a timed race down,
well, the side of a hill. There were some pretty decent jumps and some
huge burns, as well as a real gnarly rock garden.  I went pretty fast
down for a normal person, but rolled most of the jumps and tried to
generally keep my wheels on the ground. Definitely got air a few times,
but I need to get more comfortable before flying airborne down the side
of hill. Brian Lusher and Jake put in some really fast times, Brian with
full gear and Jake just beasting it on his 29er.</p>
<p>Super D</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting style of race that I'm not sure why the
ACCC is so fond of, the "Super D" is a mass-start downhill race that is
mostly downhill but also includes some flat sections.  To make the
situation slightly better, it is usually started Le Mans style which
means that the riders pile up their bikes, and the race begins with a
run to the bike.  The advantage is that we're more spread out before
hitting the hole shot onto the single track (trail only wide enough for
one bike).  The start pretty much determines the outcome of the race, so
with a few properly executed swim moves through the sprint, I was the
second guy on my bike. The first guy was in front of me, and even took a
few seconds to get as I yelled at him to ride haha, but per usual,
someone really messed up and the rest of the group was stuck behind. So
it was pretty much me, an ASU guy, and a WVU guy on a downhill bike
heading into the downhill. I let the WVU guy go first on the downhill
because he had a full suspension downhill bike, but I kept up with him
the whole time. The ASU guy flew down the hill, gapping even the WVU guy
I was behind. Problem with the "downhill" guys is that they don't really
have any fitness, so they can't pedal hard on the flats. Regardless, I
finished in 3rd at the bottom, since there isn't a chance to pass.</p>
<p>Brian Lusher and Bill took 1-2 in the Men's C which was sweet, but Jake
had an encounter with a tree (not bad) on his run and Kay came through
with 2nd, not losing much ground to Ashley on this one.</p>
<p>Course Run</p>
<p>Still in marathon-training mindset, I felt like I needed to get some
miles in, and Kay is looking to get back into running form so we went
out for an easy fun of the BURN course, the course that we were to race
the next day. It was a fun run, and tired my legs out a little for the
next day, but was good.  Kay had ridden the BURN 24-hour race on the
course earlier in the year, so it was cool for her to recount some of
the experiences she had during that race.</p>
<p>Sunday, Cross country race</p>
<p>With slightly tired legs, it was time for the long race.  We were to do
two of the 7-mile laps, and I was ready to go hard, but my legs werern't
there for the whole race.  The beginning was a sprint to the trails, and
I definitely took down some of the markers to get into fourth going into
the trails. I particularly didn't want to get stuck behind on a part
that it was possible to clip out on at the trailhead.  Going along we
were just flying, these are fast trails with burmed courners that are
built to MTB. I got a little high on one burm, and slid out. A few guys
passed me, and as we got the big uphill I was starting to fade. I fell
back a little more, getting passed at the top by Jan, and just crusied
and enjoyed the trails for a while. I'd lost quite a bit of time with my
slide out since it took a few minutes to get my chain back on. Nearing
the end of the first lap, a dude was catching up to me and said that
Ashley was gaining on us too. She's a women's pro rider, who rides for
ASU and is fast as shit.  I told him "damn, getting chicked on the first
lap," not realizing that she was actually right behind him. But he let
her around, and so did I, but I decided to see how long I could keep up
with her. So I just stuck her wheel for awhile, and we actually caught
and passed a whole bunch of the other Men's B's together. I hopped in
front for the downhill, then let her take the lead again as we started
lap 2. I hung on for awhile, but she was flying on the uphills and
eventually she rode away from me.  That was fun, and then I just rode
along until I was actually catching two NCSU guys near the end. I
starting going hard to reel them in, and caught one of them before the
final downhill. I passed him on the fire road since I knew he was a
faster downhiller and he couldn't pass on the downhill. He was right on
my wheel on the downhill, so I was nice and let him by, and came out for
the final half mile on the feild about 20m behind him. I was looking
forward to sprinting it out, and so was he. But when i went to pedal, it
turned out that on the downhill my chain had come off the big ring and
wrapped all the way around the crank. So damn, couldn't sprint by him
(which I'm pretty sure I had), but I had time to get it fixed before
anyone else had come through.</p>
<p>It was a hot day, and my clothes were soaked to it felt great to hose
off and get cleaned up. We didn't take much time packing up, I had left
my tent out to dry and it had, so that was good.  The drive back felt
short, and then I set to work on my Abstract Algebra till 2AM, taking a
break to Skype with Mom and Dad, and to go to Mass.</p>
<p>That's all for now, this weekend is the home race!</p>
