    <p>Nothing quite like getting up early to race bikes, and I'm definitely
getting old because I'm thinking how I'm going to miss mornings like
that.</p>

<p>Today's cross country race was the same course as the day before but in
the other direction. Will M, Jacob A, Robbie, and Mike B had driven down
the night before and slept at the (wrong) race site, and were there
before we got there.</p>
<p>At the start of the race, Will M, Jacob, and I started the fun train. We
were flying, and it was sweet. About two miles in, Will started slowing
down and we were losing the group in front of us. Jacob and I went
around, and before long I'd lost Jacob. And after not too much longer,
Will was gone behind me. I got passed once, but kept going as hard as I
could for the rest of the race. It was fun being able to let loose and
go fast on these trails. By the end, I'd finished in 6th place with
Jacob holding it down for 3rd.</p>

<p>Robbie did work as well, coming in second in the Men's C race, Kay
finished a mere 20 seconds behind ASU's Ashley James and Jake A had a
better race on Sunday "puttin the team on his back" and with these
efforts, the team was able to win the race over ASU! Currently, we are
tied for first place in the conference!</p>
<p>I'm racing Big Lick triathlon on Saturday which I am really excited for,
and I just got word from Evan Fulton of W&amp;M that he can give me a ride
after Big Lick back to W&amp;M to race MTB's on Sunday!! Chyeah!</p>
