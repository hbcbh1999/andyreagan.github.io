    <p>I have spent all day today writing essays and filling out applications
for research positions this summer.  Perhaps the hardest question
(besides the open ended essays) was race.  Wait what did he say? I said
race.</p>
<p>The C2B2 (Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels) application
contains gender and race as optional questions.  Virginia Tech's
Modeling and Simulation in Systems Biology program doesn't ask.  They
just have a link to survey that is not part of the application, just for
data.  For VT's MSSB, when I filled it out this morning, I chose not to
answer.  If I chose to put them in, the truth for both would be Male and
White.</p>
<p>Take a look at Tech's equal opportunity statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/va-tech.png"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/va-tech.png" title="va tech"></a></p>
<p>It makes sense to me that the only way to enfore such a policy is to not
even <em>look</em> at any of those categories.  Now look at the bottom of
C2B2's application:</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application2.png"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application2.png" title="c2b2_application2"></a>So,
they're committed to <strong>equality in education</strong>.  But then why ask these
(optional) questions in the middle of the application:</p>
<p><a href="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application.png"><img alt="" src="http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c2b2_application.png" title="c2b2_application"></a>They're
there to serve the second part of the that statement.
<strong>"Underrepresented students are encouraged to apply."</strong> Well to me,
that's nothing short of saying that they have a better chance of getting
into the program.  How is that promoting eqaulity between the black
female and me, the white male.  She's more likely to get in, based on
race.  Definitely <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span>
equal.</p>
<p>I'm pretty confident that if I submitted the application as a black
male, they probably wouldn't find out.  I mean how would they? Until I
got to Colorado and we're all white... And it's tempting, but is it
ethical?</p>
<p>Certainly it's lying.  I'm not telling the truth. But is that wrong even
if the reasons are right? Those reasons being that if they truly were
pursuing equality in education, as a "black male" I shouldn't get extra
consideration than the white male.</p>
<p>I'm ready to submit, already requested an official transcript be sent
there...and am probably going to not answer those questions.  But who
will know?</p>
