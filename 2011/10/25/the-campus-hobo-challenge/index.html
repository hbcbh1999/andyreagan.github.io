    <p>As the second challenge in the Andy vs Sam Challenge Series, we will be
attempting something I've wanted to try for awhile.  The weather has
gotten cold for this one, but here goes.</p>
<p>A while back, if I couldn't find a place to live for the semester, I had
heard of (doubt it's true) a guy who camped out for a semester by the
Duck Pond, and I was going to try it.  Granted I did find a house with
David and James, but being homeless the questions that come up
immediately were "where will I eat" and "where will I shower" or "what
about my stuff (bikes)."  However, the challenge stuck with me and I've
been wanting just to try it. The days of warm have passed, but the
questions above aren't too hard to answer for a 3-day attempt at this.
Given I'll be eating lunch at D2 every day like I always do and can
bring a camp stove to make oats in the morning and spaghetti at night
which is what I always eat now anyways. The gyms are open to students to
shower. And I'll only have what I can carry (shouldn't need more!).</p>
<p><a href="http://weburbanist.com/2007/09/28/urban-camping-subversive-city-living-from-times-square-to-the-car-tent/?ref=search"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vSyk6SJoF1M/S-cVM54yxeI/AAAAAAAAFY4/zyCGPQzI518/s1600/camping+2.jpg" title="Urban Camping"></a></p>
<p>Blacksburg is the polar opposite of NYC though, and there are parks
galore, including the Jefferson National Forest that has lots of
campsites \~3mi outside of town.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the challenge lasts 72 hours (3 days)</li>
<li>cannot go "home" in that time</li>
<li>no sleeping or showering at a friend's place (how easy would it be
    just to crash on a friends couch for three days)</li>
<li>no camping anywhere illegal (not trying to get in trouble here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where it is illegal to camp is more of an open question, but I don't
think nodding off on a book in the library will land you in trouble.
What I haven't been to strict about is food, and so you're allowed to
eat out, eat on campus, eat a friend's place. But the idea is to carry
as much of what you need as you can (definitely including textbooks
#sorryback).</p>
<p>Challenge on! I won't elaborate on my plan to accomplish this, but save
that for a post after it's went down.</p>
<h4>The first challenge: Mountain-top Sunrise</h4>
<p>Or, in Sam's case, the tallest-building-in-my-flat-town challenge :-P.</p>
<p>The result:</p>
