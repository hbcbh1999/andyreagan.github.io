Title: Visiting the IBM Watson Research Center
Date: 2016-04-13

Fellow [Computational Story Lab](http://compstorylab.org/) researcher [Eric Clark](http://www.uvm.edu/~eclark/) is spending a few months working with scientists at the [Watson Research Center]().
The project that he is a part of is really exciting, and you can read more about ``Operation Blue Sky'' in the [Forbes press release](http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymullin/2016/04/07/pfizer-ibm-launch-ambitious-internet-of-things-for-parkinsons-research/#da9309c24d62).

I went down for a day to give a talk to their weekly machine learning seminar about some of the research that I've been doing with Chris Danforth and Peter Dodds at the `Lab.
In particular, I got to share some of the latest work we've been doing to visualize happiness and understand the stories in data.

The research center and the people there are amazing, and the projects they have going are fascinating.
You aren't allowed to take any pictures though, so you'll have to take my word for it!
It was a pleasure to speak, tour the center, and meet the people on Eric's team.
