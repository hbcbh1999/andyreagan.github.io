Title: Towards the certificate of study in complex systems
Date: 2015-02-01

I'm taking three classes this semester to finish my coursework for the Certificate of Study in Complex Systems.
Having recently finished my quals, these classes will round out my plan of study with 1.5 years left to write and teach.
The classes that I'm taking are

1. Evolutionary Robotics with Professor Josh Bongard
2. Modeling Complex Systems with Professor Maggie Eppstein
3. Applied Artificial Neural Network with Professor Donna Rizzo

I'm really excited about each of these courses!
I get to first build robots and think about cognition, then model things that are interesting in the real world, and finally learn about how computers learn.

The class projects that I'm going to take on in each course can hopefully fit together and if they prove to be worthwhile, could turn into the papers that I'll need to write to finish my PhD.
I have a lot of ideas that will be kept top secret, but stay tuned!

All of my code for the courses is going up on github (full transparency!) and you can check each of those out here, referenced by their UVM course number:
