With the semester nearing an end (one final exam taken, two presentations to give next week)...professor Bagrow sums up how I feel:

A random subselection of highlights over the past two months:

- Sam's business, [Wildflower Studios](http://wildflowerstudiobtv.com/) has secured and loan, a space, a web designer (guess who), and will be opening in September
- a self-declared [win](https://twitter.com/andyreagan/status/591370586498170881) at the student research conference
- a few excellent bike rides including a [crit race](https://twitter.com/andyreagan/status/588035987957252096), and an attempt at the [6 gap](https://www.strava.com/activities/296998303) ride
- and lots of [science](https://twitter.com/andyreagan/status/583058314201841664)

And looking forward to presentating at the 2015 SIAM Conference on Dynamical Systems, weddings, research, and bike riding this summer!
