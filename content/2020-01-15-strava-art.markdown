As a passionate both data visualization practitioner and amateur fitness enthusiast,
my hobbies have neat intersection in fitness data.
I enjoy using Strava to keep track of running, cycling, and all nature of outdoor exploits,
and it just so happens that the data is really fun to make visualizations with.
I was inspired by the for-purchase data art at Sisu:

Strava has even create a whole category of integrations that make prints of data: https://www.strava.com/apps/prints
