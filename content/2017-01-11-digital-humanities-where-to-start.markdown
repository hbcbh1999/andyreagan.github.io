> Recently I read your paper "The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes", and it fascinated me. I'd love to learn more about how data scientists are able to deconstruct and graph language; where can I find similar research papers like this one, in the fields of literature and computational/data science?

A quick response from me on some work to look into:

> Thanks for reaching out! There are a number of people working the area whose work is really interesting, and this area is broadly called the "digital humanities". That name, and some of the original ideas were inspired by Moretti (see the book "Distant Reading"). You could also start by checking out the work being done by Ben Schmidt, David Bamman, and David Elson- I've seen excellent papers from all of them.
