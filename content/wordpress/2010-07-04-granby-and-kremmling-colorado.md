Yesterday we battled massive headwind (30-50mph? at 12K ft), freezing
temperatures, cars, rough roads, and the mountain itself over Trail
Ridge Road.  Our reward: conquering the highest paved road in the United
States and experiencing the beauty and wilderness of the Rocky Mountains
in a way that can only be felt.

gravel, and the winds approached 50MPH at the top haha. The descent we
also had a strong headwind, which kept our speed down a lot (probably
good!)"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/trail_ridge-300x64.png "trail_ridge")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/trail_ridge.png)[/caption]

Last night we partook in the tradition that is Bike and Build Prom, by
decorating the gym of our elementary school host not unlike many of our
high school proms.  We were still at 8,000 feet so we did our best to
stay hydrated, and it was a lot of fun.  I'm pretty sure because of the
day's ride, everyone was out by 11PM still.  My date for the prom was
Raleigh, and everyone was looking pretty ridiculous, see the pictures
below haha.

Today we slept in before our ride (for the first time ever!) and left at
noon for our shortest day yet: 27 miles.  I joked about going for the
"hour challenge," to get to our host in less than an hour, *until* we
got out on the road and were nailed with a 20mph (gusting over 40mph)
headwind.  Pedaling just as hard, it took us 90 minutes to get here, and
I think everyone made it in two hours somehow.  I got an excellent shake
and buffalo burger in town here in Kremmling, and we're excited to see
the fireworks tonight for the FOURTH OF JULY! Yeah 'Merica!!

it was a harder, but very short still,
ride!"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/to_kremmling-300x64.png "to_kremmling")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/to_kremmling.png)[/caption]

The internet here, which I'm glad we got, is slow so I'm going to try to
be a little more picky haha.  First are going to be of Trail Ridge, then
prom, and then a few from today!
