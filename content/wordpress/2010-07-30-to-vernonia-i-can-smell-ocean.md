Today we left Gresham and went through downtown Portland, into the
mountains, and began crossing the Coastal Range on our way to the ocean.
 I got some great donuts in town at Voodoo, and was relieved of my sweep
duty with Laura by Sharif and Heather.  The hills were very steep out of
town, as were the descents, and we camped tonight for the last time.
 Our last official night together, we celebrated with some paper plate
superlative awards and drinks.

Sarah C got a tandem and Jake brought it out that night, so she could
ride the last day.  I spent some time getting seats and pedals switched
onto it, and we were all really excited that she was going to be able to
ride into Cannon Beach the next day.  Hill-master Marky Mark was going
to be on the front of the Tandem pulling up the hills, and it turned out
to be a very good thing, he actually got tired!

I slept again the hammock which was excellent, I love being creative
finding places to hang it.  We were so close to being done, I didn't
even sleep that well I was so excited and was ready to go in the
morning.  I thought I took a picture of my hammock job, can't find any
of the campsite though, oh well haha.
