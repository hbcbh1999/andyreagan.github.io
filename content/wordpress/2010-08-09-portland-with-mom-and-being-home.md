After celebrating our arrival at the Pacific on the 31st, my Mom and I
spent the morning in Cannon Beach exploring the beach with Becky and
Sonya and Olivia before heading back to Portland.  We took Jesse, Alyson
and Sarah W back to Portland with us, and everybody went to Noah's
house.  From there, we packed up bikes (I completely dissambled mine
part by part because I'm crazy haha) and said goodbyes.  After checking
in to the hotel, my Mom and I got pizza at this cool little place with
tables on the ceiling and then I got to sleep in a *bed* for the night.

We spent the next day exploring Portland on a tandem bike that we rented
which was a lot of fun.  We also got to meet up with all the Bike and
Builders again which was cool.  We went up to the Rose Garden in the
hills above Portland which was nice too.

We got around so quick on the bike that we had seen pretty much all of
downtown Portland we wanted to haha, and the next day drove out the
scenic Columbia River Gorge and did some hiking amongst the waterfalls.
 For dinner we went down to Hood River to a brewery and watched the
windsurfers before heading back to catch the plane.  A nice two days,
but I was ready to get home after the whole summer!

#### Home

I haven't done too much since I've been home, my days have pretty much
went like this: wake up at noon, eat some breakfast my brother made and
then go for a bike ride.  Come back to dinner my Mom made for me, then a
few hour nap in the hammock and reading my book before friends come over
and we drink some beers around a my expert bonfires haha.  It's the
life.  My first day back, I went for a 44 mile ride and climbed every
big hill in the area including Churchill road going around Otisco Lake,
and it is steeper than anything we climbed this summer!  I went down
Munro (and back up) to see how fast I could get, but only
a disappointing 54mph... And then Friday my ride was short, with the
skin suit and I just put in some TT efforts in the bars to prepare to
the Great Race this Sunday.
