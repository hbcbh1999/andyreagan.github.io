The first race of the season today was at NC State, and for Men's C was
a 41-mile road race.  With John G's downgrade, we had seven strong C's
starting the race, and I was excited.  I wore Nick S's helmet, with a
video camera attached...but didn't get it turned on to actually record
any of the action though.  I did steal some powertap hub batteries from
Ben W's wheel, though, and got power data! Here's a quick look at the
ride.  You'll be able to see 5 laps, the second of which Will M rode
really hard on the front for most of.

Crashes kept Austin and Zac Cates from really getting any of the action,
unfortunately though.  But Andy W and Jake A fought hard and caught up
with the lead group which I was in, several times.  Nearing the end of
the last lap, another attack was launched...and I still felt strong but
my legs cramped.  I felt great the whole race, so it was somewhat of a
bummer, with only three miles to the finish.  Luckily, Andy W went on to
podium with 3rd in the race! Congrats Andy on your first race! Jake also
kept up with lead group on that attack, and was somewhere between me and
Andy...I don't know about places yet.  I had to stop and stretch my legs
because of the cramping, but was able to get back on the bike and hold
off the chasing rides to finish behind the lead group...fifteen-ish?
