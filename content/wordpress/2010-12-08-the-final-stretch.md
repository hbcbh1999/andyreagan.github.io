Classes have ended for the fall of 2010, and I'm nearly halfway through
my third year of college.  It's hard to believe that it's December, but
I realize pretty quick when I step outside to 20F and wind.  This
semester has been an absolute blast, and now I'm beginning to prepare
for all that stands between myself and home in NY: finals.

I don't really have that much to say, I'll be studying hard for my three
finals after Bike Rider's Ball tonight!  Coming home Dec 17th, with a
car full of people that I picked up via VT's Rideboard, so I'll have
company and gas money for the ride back, not to mention all of those
carbon emissions that we'll be saving!
