Today was a great day of riding, despite the monotony of the plains we
had an awesome time dressing up, napping, and swimming! Since the
terrain provided little entertainment, we had to provide our own, so we
went crazy dressing up for the day with accents and the like. At lunch I
took a very excellent nap, and we found a pool at the end of the ride
that let us in for free! Here's a look at some of the get-ups.

On the way to lunch, I caught up with these guys and had fun pulling
along, moving easily at 20mph was smooth sailin.

At lunch I got an epicly awesome nap in, using the helmet pillow! I'll
demonstrate the helmet pillow later sometime haha.  After that nap, a
bunch of us cruised at like 22mph with a slight tailwind after after an
hour of pulling, we caught up with Raleigh, Laura and Heather and they
were determined to find a pool.  We found one, they let us in for free,
and it felt great!

Then I shot some hoops in the gym (they have a really nice gym) and then
we played outside for awhile!

Since then I've played around on the internet, and finished today's and
yesterday's posts! Hope you've enjoyed the pictures, we're all really
excited to go to St. Louis tomorrow crossing the Mississippi into
another state and meeting at least two rider's whole families!
