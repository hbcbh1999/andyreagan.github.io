So today I did my first triathlon and it was awesome!! I made good time
in the swim, but bonked on the bike and suffered through the whole run,
but didn't stop to walk either.  Having 36 people there representing VT
was incredible, as we struck fear into our collegiate opponents' hearts
with a huge chant right before the start, and just so much positive
energy.  Everyone was cheering us on, and in some places it kept me
going.

Results aren't up yet, and I didn't bother to look after the race
because really that doesn't matter haha, I know I kinda stunk but
finished under 3 hours still.  There were 452 pictures on my camera so
it's really tough to pick just one...maybe I'll do a few haha:
