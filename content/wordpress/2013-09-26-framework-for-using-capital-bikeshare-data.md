In the name of open data and coding for social good, the [capital
bikeshare has released their ridership data to the
public.](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data) To start
analyzing this data, I've written some starter python scripts that
should get one started working with the data. This is the product of a
megabus ride from Saratoga Springs to Burlington.

You can find the the code that I've written at on
[github.](https://github.com/andyreagan/capital-bikeshare)
