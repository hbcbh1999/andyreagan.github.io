Today started off early again at 6:30AM, but not quite as early as the
6AM yesterday which my alarm was still set to, oops haha!

I had packed up at night and laid out the clothes for the day, so I
could take my time getting around in the morning.  It's actually quite
a hand workout rolling up the thermarest and sleeping bag SUPER tight
though haha.  Breakfast provided by the church was great, and I did
manage to get a good bit down along with my vitamin, and I was proud of
myself after the 1.5 pounds of spaghetti from dinner last night haha.

Today I was a little sore from yesterday admittedly, and I rode with
some different people which was nice.  We took a stop after 12 miles for
a nice stretch break!

<div id="_mcePaste">
The town we were headed to today is the tiny (3sq. mi.) town of Waverly,
VA, and the only real big attraction according to Emma who did the
research on this town was a "peanut museum..." So after unloading our
stuff at the church we are staying at, it was only 1PM and so to the
peanut museum we went!

Then we came back to the church eventually, I was amazed at all of the
old stuff, even found an old outhouse on the nature trail out back...

Dinner at the church was phenomenal, it consisted of macaroni and
cheese, green bean casserole, southern fried chicken, applesauce,
deviled eggs, chips and salsa, pretzels, potato salad, and normal salad
with pink lemonade to top it off! It's going to be tough to top that.

Looks like rain for our 65 mile ride tomorrow, I may try to go a little
faster today and get outta the wet if I can! Sleep calls.

Night!
