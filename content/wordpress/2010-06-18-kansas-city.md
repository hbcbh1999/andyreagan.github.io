Hey avid readers! Lots of pictures of the past three days which have
been wonderful, biking my first century (100mi) and working with Habitat
here. I'm choosing sleep over blogging tonight, but ill have stuff up
soon I promise haha. In the meantime check out the press coverage and
make sure to watch the video of the live news I was on, links on my
twitter (on the right side of this post). Thanks for reading and
goodnight!  
PS I'm curious to see how this worked from the phone!
