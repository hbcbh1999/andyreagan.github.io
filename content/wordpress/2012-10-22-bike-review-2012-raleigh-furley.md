After breaking my old single speed this spring, and with my bike being
my \#1 means of transportation, I figured it was time to invest in a
commuting machine. 1000 miles in, I'll offer up to the world my thoughts
(I couldn't find a good review myself back in Jan).

Eventually I settled on the [Raleigh
Furley](http://www.raleighusa.com/archive/2012-steel-road/furley-12/),
which met most of my criteria. I was looking for a steel/ti, road
geometry, disc brake, belt drive, internal geared machine. This guy is
cromoly, has perfect geometry for me, and disc brakes. It didn't have a
belt drive or internal gears, but as it turns out I don't need the gears
at all, and it's cheaper than the belt drive options. Belt drives fall
into the "fixing a null problem" category, since there's just nothing
wrong with a chain drive. I've dropped oil on it a couple times, but
that's it.

After 1000 miles, I've done hardly anyÂ maintenance. This thing's a tank.
Okay I'm not sure how much else I have to say. It's get the job done,
fast, and is super reliable. The brakes aren't fantastic, but they work
fine. And they work just as well in the rain.
