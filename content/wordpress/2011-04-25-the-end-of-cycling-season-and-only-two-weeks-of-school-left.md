It's been awhile since I posted, my b.

The good news is that I've been too busy riding bikes, having lots of
fun, and working hard.

First, check out the Men's C crit from the Conference Championship
weekend that happened here the weekend before last, it was awesome. Â You
can read the backstory at <http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu> and here's the

Other happenings have included finishing my application to grad school,
which I applied for in the spring of 2012, and will be hopefully in the
accelerated ugrad/grad program in the fall.

And I gave a presentation on the research that I have been doing for the
past two semesters, watch here:

A lot of work, and four finals crammed into two days, before I come
home. But that's in less than two weeks! Time to keep gettin at it.

Ciao!
