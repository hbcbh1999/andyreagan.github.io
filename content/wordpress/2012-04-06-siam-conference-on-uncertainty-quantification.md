Official statement:

> I attended the SIAM Conference for Uncertainty Quantification from
> April 2-5 in Raleigh NC and learned a great deal about UQ from the
> leaders in the field. Some talks, and projects, that I found
> accessible and of interest were in the sessions on "Hybrid Uncertainty
> Quantification Methods for Multi-physics Application" and the three
> part session on "UQ in Engineering Applications" which both explored
> methods of model reduction and solving inverse UQ problems.

Unofficial highlights:

And who could argue with a four day trip that includes this list? Sean
Connery, maybe. But I'll settle for it.
