This past Tuesday I had to the opportunity to be a part of two talks by
[Dr Jeff
Weeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Weeks_(mathematician)), the
first in my History of Mathematics and part II at the Math Club meeting.
His name is linked because he has his own wiki, sweet! The talks were
really interesting, investigating the topology (...geometry, sorta) of
space. Attempting to answer questions of whether the universe of is
finite or infinite, and what possible forms a finite universe could
have. The going explanation is that of a many-dimensional torus, the
sorta thing where if you fall off one side, you come back on the other.
Thinking about these topologies is really interesting and a fun thought
exercise to wrap your head around. Altogether, I enjoyed the talks for
sure. Here is a picture of me playing one of his [geometry
games](http://www.geometrygames.org/) on the projector during history of
math (and Dr Weeks behind me):
