Despite having to wake up in time to bike to an 8AM research meeting and
spend two hours building a logical model of iron homeostasis (which was
actually pretty fun), today was awesome and now I'm at Ben Rices uncles
house for the mtb race at NC State tomorrow.  
Yesterday was a really long day in class, but I finished both of my
homeworks for class well and left stat early (yes!) to meet Raleigh who
came up for the night from UNC!Â  Dave and I made delicious tacos for
dinner with his parents homemade salsa, my living room was a bike shop
for a while and then I took Ral on a bike ride around Blacksburg and the
drillfield by night.  
In the morning when I got back I made eggs and cheese toast sandwhiches
for a great breakfast. We hung out for a while before I went to brewing
class with the few miller high lifes left, and then packed for a weekend
of mtb racing! Id like to post the picture of our passenger van filled
to capacity haha but its on my camera. So for the pic, imagine 12 happy
mountain bikers crammed into a van haha!
