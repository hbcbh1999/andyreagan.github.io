Really, so much for a break at all.  After finishing my last final on
Thursday, driving 12hrs home Friday, driving 2hrs each way to the Reagan
Christmas on Saturday, and starting working 8hr days today...the only
day I've really had off was Sunday.  And putting in a hard workout and
lounging around watching football wasn't the kind of break I think I
need... but enough complaining.

Break is going to fly by real quick now, each weekend being planned out
already. This coming weekend is Christmas, which should be great.  And
then it's New Year's weekend.  After that, I'll be headed to DC the
following weekend for the Bike and Build reunion which I'm really
excited for.  And then it's either heading to training camp or coming
back for more work, and a work trip to Bluebell for that last weekend.
Then school on Tuesday!!  So here are my options:

\#1: Drive to DC, then continue to Blacksburg for training camp the
following week.

\#2: Drive to DC and back... no way jose

\#3: Train to DC, catch a ride back with Alyson to Ithaca,
hitchhike/bike/get a ride home from there.

​a. Work the following week, go to Bluebell in OBG car (they're taking
one) and come back with them Sun night.  Drive down to school Monday
from home.

​b. Work the following week, drive to Bluebell with all my stuff.  Then
continue on down to Blacksburg Sunday night.

I think laying it out like that helps me think it through.  Picking
apart \#1 vs \#3... the money is the only reason I would work the extra
week, having already put in three weeks.  Training camp will help me
this season in Men's B, but not sure how much.  We're talking about
something like \$600 here.  That's more than two month's rent...
Tough decisions!  Since I don't really want to take Kazane on the train,
and wasn't thinking to bring fixie home, I just inquired about a fixed
gear bike on craigslist just for the trip.  It's \$200, but no doubt I
could sell it in Bburg for at least that.

So, I'll figure it all out! Right now leaning on coming back to SYR to
work, then driving from Bluebell down to Tech, if none of the people I
gave rides to need one back down.
