I unknowingly lost my hokie passport today on Harding Ave, but luckily
Kristen F found it, and dug the interwebs to find and email me! I just
wanted to thank her, and share the story because it made me think about
how accessible all this information is... Although I am pretty hard to
find without sharing my VT account (on VT-stalk as some people call the
vt.edu people-search engine) and without having a Facebook, which I
deleted this semester as one more distraction, it was possible to find
my email, phone number, address...all with just my name!  I'm proud of
my number one google ranking for "andy reagan" searches, and it helped
save me \$20 (paid for the website for two years!).  I think that some
people would worry about having that information accessible, and maybe
I'm naive, but I'm really not bothered at all that someone who can
navigate the web can look me up, I think that in itself is pretty
harmless.

Here's the email correspondence:

*K: Hey...  
I found your Hokie Passport on the side of the road...  
Did you cancel it and get a new one? or do you need it?  
Just let me know!*

*Me: Kristen, thanks so much for taking the time to email me!  If you
could drop it off in the lost and found in Squires next time you're near
there, that would be perfect.  Thanks again!*

*K: Sure- no problem... It was on the side of the road on Harding Ave,
just to let you know...I have class at 9:30 tomorrow, so I will drop it
off either before or after it. By the way, it was really hard to find
your email address because you aren't on the Student Look-up thing.Haha
anyway, no problem! Should be there tomorrow!*

*Me: Awesome, and it makes sense that it was on Harding, I live up
Harding and bike to class.  Sorry that I was hard to find though, how
did you find me haha?*

*K: Haha well I googled you and found your Linkedin and Twitter but
there wasn't an email so then I found your website, but your email
address wasn't anywhere, and I couldn't find your Facebook. So I had to
creep pretty hard and I found your resume and it had your email. Haha
Don't judge. It worked :)*

*Me: Wow, I'm impressed!  Yeah I have a really hard semester, so deleted
my Facebook cause I would spend an hour a day procrastinating on it
lol.  And I'm not sure why my VT stuff doesn't show up.  Sounds like it
just became a challenge to find me haha but don't worry I don't judge,
I'm glad you could find me!!*

*K: Haha yup... and that makes sense... I'd hope someone would do the
same for me!*

*Etc...*

And I finished my numerical methods HW, so I'm not just procrasting
right now either. Check out one cool little code I wrote, it saves me
work:

for that matter, check out some of the cooler code I wrote to do work
for me in [Number Theory Problem Set
1](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ps1.docx).

That's all for now, goodnight!
