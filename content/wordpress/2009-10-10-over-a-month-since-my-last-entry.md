I knew it had been awhile since I wrote on here, but didn't realize it
had been so long! Guess that about sums up what I have been up to, a
lot! Don't really even know where to start, but here of some highlights
of the last month:

The coolest two things I have done have gotta be learning to sail, and
riding my bike 140 miles to Polyface Farm (and the visit to Polyface,
check them out
atÂ [www.polyfacefarms.com!](http://www.polyfacefarms.com/))! I have some
pictures of Polyface, the ride there, and of Lauren and I that I might
try to put up here soon! I've worked all the home football games...been
keeping up with all of my homework...I made a website for the Blacksburg
Bike Co-op ([www.bikeblacksburg.org!](http://www.bikeblacksburg.org/)),
and am on the board of the co-op now, which I am taking on as my ESers
in Action project we have to do for Earth Sustainability...applied,
interviewed, and got accepted on the SGA Transportation
Committee...ordered \$22,000 worth of clothing...and well that's about
all I can think of now haha!

Hm well Lauren is here, so I think that's all you're gonna get for now!
Stay tuned!
