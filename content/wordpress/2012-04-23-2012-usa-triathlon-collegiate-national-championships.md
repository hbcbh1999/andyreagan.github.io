I'm writing here on June 18, 2012, since I never did get a chance to sit
down and type about the race (and have post-dated the entry).

Anyway, in short, I had a great deal of fun and am very grateful having
been able to take part in a "national championship." My race was far
from national caliber, and actually a bit disappointing with my (lack
of) ability to swim. Here are some highlights that I can recall.

-   I almost missed the plane (my alarm failed, phone was off, and Eric
    woke me up because tri kids almost banged the door down)
-   The entire trip down, it was the UVM Tri skinsuit babyyy (securing
    my bet of four energy bars from @ttmill)
-   Flatulence was common theme, as I was repeatedly out-done by one
    Colby Nixon
-   Note to self: don't wear a wetsuit that's way too small, kill
    yourself at 185bpm for a 35min swim, then be exhausted for your two
    decent legs
-   \^ that's what happened in my race, whoops
-   Despite the strip-malls indistinguisable from the rest of America,
    Tuscaloosa is a nice place
-   Sorority girls at UA wear "norts"
-   Mullets, mustaches, and very short jean shorts were a hit (before,
    during, and after the race I might add)
-   It was really great catching up w Va Tech folks I hadn't seen in
    awhile...we dominated Olive Garden with a party of 35
-   I slept on a park bench downtown one night (for a few hours, I was
    tired after all)

And that's a pretty solid trip.
