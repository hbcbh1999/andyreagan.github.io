After surviving my two hard tests of the day, I joined some other bike
crazies from BBurg and we went to Roanoke for the STARBOMB
([www.starbomb.info](http://starbomb.info/)).Â  Inspired by Portland's
ZooBomb, they catch a shuttle to the
[Star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_Star) at the top of the
mountain, and ride down on kids bikes!! It was a super fun night, I rode
down on my fixed gear and we did a critical mass around town getting
cheered on from all the bars, then ended at a bar!
