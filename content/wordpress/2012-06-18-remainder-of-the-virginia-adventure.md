#### Thursday

While I slept in for a long long time (Worlds really did kick my butt
apparently), Sam continued to work on the giant Jenga set for Matt and
Kelsey's wedding gift. By the time I got up, she was almost done
staining it.

Highlights for the day included going on a trail run/ride (I ran, Sam
rode) w Rachel in the afternoon and shooting a round of disc golf w
Bradner. For dinner, we met my cousin Mary Kate at Cabo Fish Taco, and
that was great seeing her. She's due in two weeks, and is doing really
well! Chris couldn't make it with a nephew in town, but the tacos again
did not disappoint! Note: try to make that spinach dip at home...yum.

Afterwards drinks w Paul and Ruthie got competitive, and you can be the
judge of the following drawings:

#### Friday

Most of Friday was concerned with the following ride, followed by a
yummy Chipotle burrito, of course.

Check it out: <http://connect.garmin.com/activity/186913475>

Having never been to Floyd for a Jamboree myself, Sam and I headed down
to the south, west corner of Virginia for a real southern experience.
Every Friday night, Floyd is host to a jamboree, which basically means
banjo, fiddle, upright bass, and guitar players of all sorts fill the
streets for live, local, homegrown music. We got some local ice cream,
and even went for a really good pizza (and a super good Ommegang beer)
at a little brick oven pizza joint w music playing. Here's some of the
music:

#### Saturday

After making final touches to the Jenga set, loading up the car, and
going to an amazing breakfast at Gillies (and seeing the guys off on the
their long ride from Bollos), Sam and I headed for Boydton, Virginia.
Located in the middle of nowhere, near the NC border, we managed to
severely confuse the GPS unit by hopping on the Blue Ridge Parkway for a
little while, but still made it in time to be ready for the wedding.

The wedding itself was fantastic, on the waterfront at the Preddy's
gorgeous home. And the reception was even more fun, filled with dancing
and complete with open bar. It was really great to see a lot of my
family, and I was super glad to be there to see Matt and Kelsey embark
on their journey together.

#### Sunday

This one will be short: 14 hours of driving back to Vermont!! Although
there are a few highlights: which include making the trip alive, and
getting 38.5mpg.

Thanks for reading :)
