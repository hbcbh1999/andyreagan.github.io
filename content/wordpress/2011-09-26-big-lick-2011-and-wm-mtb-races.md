I had an epic weekend this past weekend with a PR in an Olympic distance
triathlon and attempting to hold on to first place in ACCC mountain
biking conference (Men's B).

I beat every single leg (including transitions) from my first triathlon
at Big Lick last year to finish in 2:29, and am really happy with my
race. Â If I learn how to swim, and train more than never in my aerobars,
I could perhaps knock that down even further.

The plan was going to be to leave from the Tri with Evan from W&M to
head up there and try to catch the short track race at 4PM...it would've
been really tight with the triathlon starting at 9AM and a four hour
drive, but it turned out that Saturdays races were cancelled due to an
onslaught of rain. It had poured on Friday while I set up for the
triathlon at Smith Mtn Lake State Park too. So, making a very long story
short, I drove back to Bburg after the race, and rode with the cycling
team to Williamsburg to spend Sat night there, and race on Sunday. When
I was first loading up my bike in Blacksburg for the MTB race, I thought
we were heading up for just Sunday's XC, but W&M pulled together 3 races
which was awesome, and really tough. Without much attendance from other
schools, VT was able to clean up and win every race as a team with
strong performances in each field. A long day/weekend for sure, and my
body was reelin, but just some swimming for today and I should be
golden.

I'll perhaps write more after this week, I've got three big tests!
