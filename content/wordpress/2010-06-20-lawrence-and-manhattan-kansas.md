Yesterday we biked into Lawrence, college home of Christina at KU! It
was a very interesting ride there, for sure, and I got to swim and check
out a cool bike shop at night.  Today into Manhattan was long in miles,
but flew by and was a great ride.  Our hosts here had an awesome array
of food set out for us, and are making Lasagna right now!

#### To Lawrence in pictures (yesterday, 6.19)

caption="And then after we got off the trail for lunch, they had found a
really nice
park!"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/009-300x200.jpg "009")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/009.jpg)[/caption]

And then after lunch, it looked like rain for sure.  We were on some
really nice country roads, out in the middle of nowhere...and they
turned gravel.  I wasn't a happy camper about that, but we made it over
the gravel without flats so it was all good! We stopped to fill up our
tires with air, and were dripping sweat with the heat and humidity after
working hard across gravel.  But then, the most insane temperature
change that I have ever felt took place, and it was windy and pretty
cold immediately! The sweat and coldness made me a little cold, and it
was definitely going to rain now.

We came to a closed road, and apparently some motorcyclists had come
back and told other people that there was a bridge down.  I rode through
the barriers yelling "Never surrender!" haha and really wanted to go
check it out for myself (it was only a mile away and I'm almost certain
we could have passed it on bikes) but the leaders told me I had to take
the detour, lame.

As we were going around the bridge, the skys opened with a rain so cold
and hard that people thought it had hailed because it hurt so bad.  I
was yelling "OW!" and a few other things as we tried to push through it,
Jesse Mark and I at the front now.  After a little bit, the water was
getting in my eyes and stinging so bad I couldn't really open them so I
reached into my bag and put on my swim goggles lol.  I couldn't see
hardly anything with those either, but could see the white line on the
side of the road and hugged that.  At a stop sign, a guy in a pick-up
asked me if I wanted a ride, that we must be crazy, but I'm still
determined to ride every inch although it was a tempting offer.

Eventually the rain let up, Mark must've been feeling great because he
had ridden away fast and it was just Jesse and I.  We saw someone coming
up to us, and we were by no means going slow, and Zach had caught us! He
complained a little bit about how hard we were to catch (kidding) and I
was really impressed, it must've been some effort.

Then we came back for dinner, another swim to cool off, and I passed out
on a couch hard haha.  I barely even woke up for the security alarm that
went off in the night.

#### Today's ride

Today started out again at 5AM, although I was so warm and comfy on that
couch I bummed it till 5:30 haha.  They had Honey Bunches O' Oats which
are quickly becoming my favorite cereal, and we actually got around to
leaving by 6:30! I was on clean up crew, and didn't get out till a few
minutes later after sweeping the floor though.

We started out at a relaxed pace, me on the front of a group at about
17MPH just keepin my pedals moving haha.  We saw some awesomely cool
clouds, some that looked like glaciers beyond mountains.  I got some
pictures when we stopped to prepare for rain (cover the camera, and
others put on rain jackets).

Lunch 1 at mile 35 (we had two because the heat index was at 104) was
good, and we went pretty hard between lunch 1 and 2.  Zach caught up to
us and pulled for 10 miles, Mark pulled for 10, and I pulled hard for
another 10.  It ended up just being us three by that time, although
Emily and Kristen weren't far behind at all.

At lunch a whole bunch of people caught up, and we took off with a big
group to try a big paceline haha.  We were doing one mile pulls, and our
goal was 17mph but with a strong tailwind, we were soon goin 23! Then
not too far along, about 8 miles from the host, Zach got a flat.  Him
and I tried to patch it, and after doing all that it was leaking, and we
found another hole... So we checked it out again and put another tube in
it.  It had been like 20 minutes, so we told the rest of the group to
head on.  After about 30 we were back on the road, and basically just
cruised into town, movin easily at 23 with that tailwind on the flats.

Our wonderful hosts at the First Methodist Church tonight had all sorts
of goodies, an entire kitchen worth, set out for us to eat when we got
here! They had gatorade and soda and water on ice and made us lasagna
for dinner, it was awesome! Showers were over at the First Presbytarian,
and there was only one so it was a wait but no biggie.

I got a chance to call my Dad on this father's day which was nice to
chat, and talked to Mom for a little too, and sounds like they're doing
well! I'm super glad for their support on this trip, it has been
awesome!

That's all for now, I'm going to try to get some pictures in the last
post, and check out the video that I'm going to put up of our build day.
 Thanks for reading!
