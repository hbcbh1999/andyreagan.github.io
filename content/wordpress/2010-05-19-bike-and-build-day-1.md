Today I got ready for the trip with some final packing...really just
waited for 2PM (and saw some dolphins on the beach before heading over)
and after a day's worth of orientation, Bike and Build is now underway!

We've been through the first day of orientation, a lot of getting to
know names and learning more about our trip that begins so soon!  I've
helped fix a lot of bikes, and distributed all 39 of the laundry loops
that I ordered for everyone too.

I feel like I already know everybody's name, many I learned before the
trip.  Despite a mishap with my wheel today (I broke a nipple and need a
special tool to fix it), I'm totally ready to set off and beyond
excited!!
