Moving my maple jalapeno ipa to secondary, where here I soaked and
cleaned the carboys, and added maple and hops to the secondary. the
pepper extract will come into the keg

tough to clean the insides, but a bent piece of copper did the trick.
having been soaked for a few days in soapy water was key

rinse

shake

rinse again

sanitize

drain beer

yummy

hop and fermentation leftovers, tasty!

Vermont grade B, kids

add hops, top off the airlocks w vodka (it's not much good for anything
else, got it for pepper extraction)

so that's about it, we wait a week and keg this bad boy. actually, I'm
leaving at 7AM on next Friday for Chile/Patagonia...should I give it a
long secondary or a long carbonation time? we shall see about that
