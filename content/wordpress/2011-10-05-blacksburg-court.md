I was obliged to spend 3.5 hours today in Blacksburg's lovely municipal
building, and it was quite a frustrating experience. My court date was
for 8:30AM, and I was not out before noon.  In the meantime, I missed my
two most important classes and got nothing done.

Arriving what I thought was none-too-early, at 8:20, I was suprised to
see a small crowd gathered outside the court, with tickets in hand, who
had apparently all been scheduled for 8:30 when the court opens. I had
let Dr. Brown know that I was going to be late to class, but didn't
think I was going to miss that, and my Real Analysis class, entirely. We
all sat in the courtroom for an HOUR until the judge came in, at which
point each case was heard one by one.  There were at least 20 cases of
people not present, where a lawyer would take many cases. We kept
hearing cases getting dismissed as "defective equipment" and \$150
fines, and all these people were getting off.  A lot of the cases
weren't related to traffic incidents even.

Well, I don't really even want to waste more time writing about it. I
got off with a "defective equipment," given the choice between that
(\$25, no points on my license) and a \$10 fine but with points on my
license, after I explained that I didn't see how it could be justified
that I receive points on my driving record for something that didn't
involve a motor vehicle. I took the defective equipment and was on my
way.

Was getting the points off of my license worth three hours of my time,
and my classes? I don't think so. At least not considering what I'm
paying per hour of class time, and how important the instruction is to
my performance in the class (and then to grad school, etc). Conclusion,
just follow the laws. Such a waste of time and money not to.
