caption="I found a machete in the basement haha, and it was covered in
really thick rust but I decided I was going to clean it up and sharpen
it! After a metal brush wasn't doing anything to get the rust off, Dave
got out the powersander and a "flap disk." In the picture is David on
the front porch at 11PM grinding the rust off lol. So here is the moment
I tried to capture haha, this is our house: while I was sharpening the
machete making lots of noise and sparks on the front porch, Dave was
hanging upside down in his back stretcher playing a harmonica and James
was baking shortbread cookies, delicious shortbread cookies...love
it."][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2788-300x200.jpg "IMG_2788")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2788.jpg)[/caption]
