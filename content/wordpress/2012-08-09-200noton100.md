On July 28, David Henry and myself joined Ted King, Tim Johnson, and
Ryan Kelley for the longest and most awesome day I've ever spent on a
bike. We rode: rode hard, rode easy, and by the end my legs felt nothing
at all as the miles went by with the hours and the elation of our
destination grew stronger. Never have I had such an awesome welcome to a
party, nor a finish to a bike ride, but the applause and outstanding
hospitality of Scratch Baking Co delivered on every level.
