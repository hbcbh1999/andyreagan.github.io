Personally caving under[Dr.
Brown](http://www.math.vt.edu/people/ezbrown/)'s requirement to type
math homework, after spending too many late nights fighting with
equation editor in MS Word, I learned and am now a huge fan of LaTeX.
It's what mathematicians write papers (and books) in, and makes typing
math homework a breeze. It is usually quicker than writing homework by
hand, once you get the hang of it.

The learning curve was somewhat harsh to me, so without too much help on
the interwebs, I'm here to help. I've made a short video intro to LaTeX
that should hopefully get you rolling on your first homework assignment
in 15 minutes.

more structured video in the near future.

And here is a really awesome tool to find out symbols that you're not
sure of:
