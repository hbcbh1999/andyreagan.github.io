A legend in Blacksburg, the "stripper-trike" as once known, has been
welded back into functionality by yours truly.  Bringing it to Jackson
St from Glade Rd was an adventure in itself.  I since took it apart,
welded it back together, rebuilt the bearings and it rides
like...something.  Today I affixed a half-working cantilever front
brake, and rode 'er to class without flipping over!

Tonight Stephan and I might hit the streets, grilling hot dogs and
roasting marshmellows for drunk people downtown.  Without furthur adue,
check it out:

I didn't take any pictures of actual welding because I was afraid for
the camera's sensor burning...

I rode it to class this morning as well, and I got some pretty good
looks.  Towed stephan up to McBryde and his bike, on the back, and that
was tough.  Then I gave some girls on the drillfield rides and confirmed
that I'm probably going DT tonight to tow people around for fun lol.
