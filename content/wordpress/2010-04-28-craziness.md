My last couple weeks have been crazy, and I haven't had a chance to blog
at all.  In fact, it's 1AM now and I should be sleeping for a big test I
have tomorrow.  But just a quick update:

I have been spending lots of time sending out more clothing orders,
updating the [VT Cycling website](http://www.cycling.org.vt.edu),
studying for tests (lots of them), and planning the community bike ride
that went down last Friday.

I've attached the 7-page manuscript describing the whole process that it
took to plan the ride, which is a pretty good read! Click here: [Tour de
Blacksburg Community Bike Ride
Manuscript](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Tour-de-Blacksburg-Community-Bike-Ride-Manuscript.pdf)

And here's a link to flyer: [Apr23 Community Bike Ride
Flyer](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Apr23-Community-Bike-Ride-Flyer.pdf)

All in all, things have been going great, I did very well in Mass and
Energy Balances, well enough in Organic Chemistry, and am optimistic
about today's test.

The Bike and Build trip is only 21 days away from right now...and there
is so much left to do!! Forms and making a presentation, and
training!?!?!

I have been healing up very well from when I got crashed out  in the
home race, and am thankful for that.

That's all for now, I needed to get something up here haha, more to come
hopefully!!

Here's some fun pictures from the ride I suppose:
