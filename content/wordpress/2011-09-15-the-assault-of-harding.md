Today the militia was gathered, and with the likes of Justin C, Mike B,
Andy W, Will M, Tyler G, Robbie, Zach M, Cody we fought. And we
prevailed. It was windy and cold, but as a team we rode.

At the bottom, I sat behind Mike and Will. Will went off, but we reeled
him back in by the middle. Cody led Mike Will and I across the middle,
whench the three of us attacked the notch. Mike and Will crushed the
notch, Mike said he saw 770 watts lol. They had gapped me, and I chased
after them to the top, finishing in a personal record 10:19!! Two
minutes faster than I ever have before, I was happy with this effort.

When I first got the Kazane, I rode Harding all out to have a baseline.
Nearly two years ago, I was at 13:30.

Here's the Strava leaderboard:
