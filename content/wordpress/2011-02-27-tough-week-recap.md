Mom and Pops, sorry I didn't get a chance to call today, I was doing HW
then eating then reading at Mass and then figured y'all would be
sleeping at 9:30...I'll try to call tomorrow. I was thinking about
calling all day, isn't it the thought that counts?

Figured I'd talk about this week, since I've survived in good health and
high spirits.  I still do have a hard exam coming up Tuesday, but I
think that I can do well if I study a lot.  Whoops, I just looked and
the midterm isn't till a week after that, on the 15th...we don't have
class Tuesday! So that means I don't have class till 5PM...I'm thinking
time for a long ride finally.

Anyway, I got B on the number theory test, which I was happy with.  I
messed up a little on one problem (there were 6 hard proofs) so I can
still feel good about it, had I not made that mistake I would've had an
A! Class avg was a C.  I'm standing at a B in the class.  In Advanced
Calc, I got an 83 on the test which was actually a little better than I
thought I had done immediately after taking it, and it being one of the
hardest 3000-levels at the university (supposively), I'll take that one
too.  I have a 92 HW average which is great, so I can possibly pull a
low A in the class.  I finished and handed in my numerical analysis
computing project, which was a whole bunch of writing MATLAB polynomial
interpolation algorithms, and it wasn't too too hard but took me a lot
of time.  On Tuesday, I left the house near 7AM and didn't return until
10:30PM.  In the middle of the day, I had to decide between going on a
training ride, d2 (food) or going to the job fair with the resumes I had
printed out.  I ended up going to d2, since I do need to eat food, and
then taking the extra time to work hard on my presentation for research
that I had at 4.  The presentation went really well, and I'm super
anxious to hear about whether or not I get the job offer this summer.  
Really hoping for it.

Unfortunately, on Monday our intramural basketball team lost in the
playoffs, but we have one more game tomorrow at 7:30.  I'm pretty pumped
to shoot some hoops after the game...I know can out free throw the VT
team...42%...

Wednesday night I finished welding the trike back together, which was my
release for the day.  Thursday I did as much C++ programming as I could,
to free my mind from MATLAB and LaTeX before the exam at 5PM.  I think
the exam went well, I'll find out soon enough.  Actually I just went and
it was up....83.  Not too pleased with that.  But it's only 10% of the
grade, and the 6 projects are worth 50%, and I knocked out the one due
Friday on Monday and got an 104 on it.  I got  an 104 on the first one
too...I'll be okay.

After the exam on Thursday, Dave and I went camping up above Mtn Lake at
the War Spur overlook.  We set out for Wind Rock, but the fire road was
pretty washed out with some boulders that I didn't end up risking my oil
pan on.  People thought we were crazy, since it was raining for the
first time in a long time, and was pretty freaking cold.  But out there
hiking, it wasn't too wet and I was down to a t-shirt, carrying in my
frame backpack on the trail.

Friday morning is when I finished putting the trike together before
class.  I actually rode it to class which was fun, and towed some people
around.  After more delicious d2 for lunch (I went a total of 4 times
this week somehow), I used the trike to deliver water bottles to the
team, to East Coasters, and pick up Christian's truing stand.  That
night, I went to build a wheel....and totally failed. I had made the
order online with a hub in it, but Dave wanted to use his own hub so we
just deleted the one online, but we bought a 32 hole rim, 33
spokes...and his hub was 36 spoke! I didn't realize it until I had the
stand all set up, nipples out and was putting the spokes into the rim.

Friday night I went to a salsa dancing thing that CRU put on, with
Jessey, and had a lot of fun.  I was pleasantly suprised that I knew a
bunch of people there...Bryan and Katie Matthews and basically everyone
I know from CRU. And Olivia from Tri team too! I was really needing to
finish the beer in my keg, and Stephan came over so kindly to help me
out, we were planning on going downtown to grill and sell hot dogs from
the trike.  I thought that there were at most a couple of beers left, so
I opened the whole keg up, and uh-oh...it was slightly full.  Well, not
full, but close to a gallon or something! It had felt so light.  Had I
known, I should have recruited more help!! We managed to finish it...ohh
so good black IPA...but didn't make it downtown lol.

Saturday was a lot of fun, I'm probably repeating a bunch from the
previous posts.  After going to college gameday in the AM and getting
some HW done (gameday was super cool, I got four carol lee donuts for
free for brkfst!), Jeff and I started a day of building, brewing, and
kegging with a trip on the trike to Eats for brewing supplies.  Jeff
isn't a small guy by any means, but we made it there! I'm sure Main St
traffic wasn't as appreciative, but oh well for them.  We managed to keg
my Raison D'etre for Tuesday's competition, brew the IPA (well...maybe
an I\*amber\*A really, it's not pale), and build a bench onto the trike.
 Before the game, I made three trips from the parking lot below Lane up
to Cassell...and I think I shoulda picked a path that wasn't up the side
of a hill! The first group of took up, of two people, bet me that I
couldn't get all of us and the huge bike up the hill...well I showed
them wrong! The lady was a cyclist, and she was thoroughly impressed,
said I must've had "legs of steel" cuz we were cruisin up the hill
blowin by traffic and everybody walking.  I then took one guy up, which
was a slight relief to legs, and went down for a final trip.  I talked a
group of three into taking a ride up, and as a challenge! They didn't
think I could do it either.... I stood and pedaled for everything I was
worth all the way up that hill, and got all four us and the bike to the
top!!  I would've loved to have had a power meter on that ride, we were
cookin up the hill...and I was pretty close to collapsing.

The game was amazing, check out the video in the previous post!  And
then today, I slept in (a lot) and have finished all of my work for the
week!  To do my math HW, I usually write it out then type it into an
email since I don't have a LaTeX compiler on the computer.  Sometimes, I
just straight do the HW on the computer, but that's hard to do.  Here's
what it looks like:

I'll post up what that actually comes on looking like, it looks great.
 It's actually the typesetting program that mathematicians use to write
papers to submit them to journals, and probably what my textbook is
written in.  Useful to know I suppose.  [Here is what it comes out
to.](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3224_HW5.pdf)

That's all for now. This week: not as crazy, going to decide about
spring break plans (possibly traveling home, we shall see).

Ciao!

PS: I'm going on a bike ride tomorrow at 3PM, check out the weather for
then:
