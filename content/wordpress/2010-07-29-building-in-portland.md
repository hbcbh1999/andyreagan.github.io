An excellent build day, we were all put to work and got a lot done!  We
got shuttled to the build site, which was closer to the city, and then
shuttled back for showers, and shuttled downtown for dinner at a brewery
arranged by an alum, Sarah, and her roommate who coordinated our build
with Habitat.

My group consisted of Joe, Zach, Jesse B and myself.  A power build team
if there ever was one, so we thought.  We were putting up the siding,
which was pain-in-the-@\$\$ off-brand "hardy board."  It didn't cut
well, and we had to try quite a few times to make some pieces that fit
around stuff.  By lunch, we had hung a net of 0 boards haha, as we had
to take down two from the day before, but we had the hang of it by then
and made some real progress by day's end.  Lots of pictures actually!

The dinner was at Green Dragon Brewery, and I got have two excellent
local beers, an amber and a stout.  They had door prizes, and as I was
leaving I snagged a t-shirt haha.  I caught a ride and navigated with
Debbie, Jen's Mom up to Alberta Street where there was this HUGE street
fair goin on.  It's called Last Thursday, and the last thursday of every
month people come out to sell homemade stuff, play really awesome music
all over the place, make food, and hang out.  It was about 20 blocks
long, and the streets were *full* of people for every one of those!  At
the end of the night I got a ride back in the B&B van so I didn't have
to take the bus.  The concentration of hipsters was crazy, soooo many
bikes and bike art and fixies...and I felt like I fit right in with the
mohawk haha.
