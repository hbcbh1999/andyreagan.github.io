Among other things (like my two tests this week (tomorrow and Thurs
night) my impending first marathon (4D 9HR) and finishing my UVM
application) I've been working on my project for my modeling of math bio
class, which is extending a model of opinion dynamics. There are two
opinions, A and B, and anyone can hold one of both of these. In each
population, there are zealots with fixed opinions, and by varying these
two zealot percentages and looking at the steady of states of the system
I observe this: (as the % of SS in opinion A)

You are looking at the region where 0 ≤ p ≤ .3, 0 ≤ q ≤ .3. Using
matlab's fsolve, I'm not getting all of the steady or really the ones
I'm interested in (so I haven't implented checking whether they're
stable yet)...so it's a work in progress but that's research I suppose.
