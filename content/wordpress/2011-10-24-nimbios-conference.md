This past weekend I traveled to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville
for an undergraduate conference at the interface of mathematics and
biology. Paul, Emily, Jim, and myself were afforded the opportunity to
present our research from the summer, and it was a fun trip. The other
speakers and poster presenters had interesting things to say, and it's
great being a part of the community that will be pursuing the future of
scientific research.
