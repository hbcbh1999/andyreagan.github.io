Rumors began to circulate the office that both of the \#storylab leaders
Chris and Peter were contesting the Shelburne Sprint Triathlon, and the
buzz grew. Since coming to UVM in the spring, young grad student Andy
had been waiting for a shot at racing against the speedy Dodds, and we'd
all heard stories that Chris had been training by carrying 50 pound
rocks over his head while leaping around the island. Surfer
extraordinaire and PhD student Cathy had been looking to complete her
first triathlon, and grad student Morgan had been spotted churning out
laps in the UVM pool between bouts of running to drink beer \#hashing.

My plans to bike to the race were spoiled when I awoke an hour before
the start, and rushed to get there, thinking I would definitely miss the
race. It turned out that Peter was actually out of town, and Cathy
nearly missed the start as well. Morgan and I began to wonder if Chris
was even going to show, noticing his tweets about NYT pieces when we
were getting ready for the water.

Alas, Chris and then Cathy did arrive, and the gang of four began our
triathlon journey. A shallow swim allowed Reagan to utilize the dolphin
dive (wearing toe shoes for the zebra mussels) technique to gain an
early lead on the whole field. Chris had hung back to avoid getting
kicked in the face, and the wetsuitted Reagan was out of the water
first.

Without biking the entire summer, I'm not sure how Chris managed to
average 20MPH over the 15 mile loop on his old steel steed, but he did.
Riding in time trial position, I had a good bike leg, and Morgan didn't
lose much time. Cathy was riding was it likely the heaviest bike in the
race, a mountain bike at that, and finished in good time considering.

Heading out on the run, I saw Chris and then Morgan (and Nuts from
\#hashing) coming in on the bike, and I was feeling good. After the
turnaround on this out-and-back run, I spotted a dude that had to be
about 300m back from me who looked my age. A friendly nod to eachother
was followed by a craning of necks to spy the age on the other's calf.
His compression sleeves obscured his number, but since he was looking as
well, I assumed that he was in my age group. So I stepped on the gas.

Feeling good![/caption]

Triathlon is an individual effort for most people, as it had always been
in the past for me. There are waves starting in front and behind you, so
you can never know if the people on the course next to you even started
at the same time. So you're doing your own race. The professionals
however are racing. They are all together, and out on the run their
finishing place is their actual place. That's what I felt like, knowing
that this other guy was coming for my age group and we had started at
the same time.

the competition![/caption]

Checking my watch, I was at a 6:30 pace and if he could bring me back at
that...I figured kudos to him. I never saw him again, and had actually
pulled away to my satisfaction. I credit my finishing pace to everyone
else on the course out there. A lot of people were heading out as I was
coming in, and I gave high fives to every willing runner on the way out.
Rather than slow me down, I realized after one high five that by feeding
off of that positive energy, I could run even faster. And it felt great.

My best overall finish, I was in 6th overall, and also a first: not
chicked. At least I think it's a tri/running first. Very happy with my
performance, I was glad to see Chris finish strong with his son Afton
and Morgan cross his first finish line. Cathy came through after and
achieved her goal as well.

Twas a good day!
