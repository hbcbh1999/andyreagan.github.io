Hey so I can’t get onto AndyReagan.com with the phone right now (I need
to go change a setting and don’t have internet lol)…so here goes my
first post with the phone!

This weekend Lauren invited me to come to her beach house (thanks
Lauren!) and it has been really fun so far. Since typing on the
touchscreen is not my favorite thing either haha here’s a list of some
of the things we’ve got to try:

-spend lots of time together on the 6 hour ride haha  
-i tried oyster, crab cakes, mahi mahi, and I’m sure some other seafood
at dinner Friday night and it was all really good, thanks for the dinner
Lauren grandparents!  
-got buried in the sand today by Lauren haha  
-swam (froze) in the 50 degree ocean in April…  
-saw a huge pack of dolphins!!! had to be like 15, and I couldve swam
right out to them they were so close  
-walked around the south shore of the island which was fun  
-tried a bunch more foods tonight and am drinking sweet tea, my
southern roots makin a comeback I guess lol  
-stayed undefeated in games at the beachhouse, winning rummikub, hand
and foot with Lauren, against Lauren in connect four (although she beat
me twice…so I guess not undefeated…she thinks that I let her win, but I
didn’t…but if she thinks I did then ill maintain that I am undefeated
lol), and I taught Lauren how to play chess haha  
-and just hanging out on the beach was sweet, I think a stogie wouldve
perfected it haha jk

and here’s some pics I took!

think I deleted a couple by accident haha idk…anyway thanks for reading!
