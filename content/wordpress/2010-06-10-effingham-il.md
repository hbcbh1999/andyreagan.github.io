Today, I for the first time left the Eastern Time Zone! We crossed the
border into the flat, windy, farms of Illinois and after biking to the
post office and to showers, I logged 73 miles on the day! This morning,
we all (yes, all 31 of us) put on make-up, eye shadow really, in an
attempt to look as good as Christina too haha. Most of us looked pretty
scary lol.

We didn't have internet at our host, although I bought an ethernet cable
in hopes that the wall port would work haha. So apologies that this is
going up late I guess.

Last night I didn't really get a chance to finish the blog either, but
came back and started reading the book that I had brought with me on the
trip: "It's Not About the Bike" by Lance Armstrong. Tonight, I finished
it! That's how I read books, because I really enjoy reading and so once
I get started I don't want to put it down. Also helps that I had four
hours today to lay under a tree when it was beautiful out and read,
which was real nice.

Today's riding was good, it was windy but it really wasn't that bad at
all. For the first time, we could see the flatness of the land extending
through farms for miles. Some of the silos and elevators made tractor
trailers look small haha.

I got to ride hard in the aerobars, and after lunch I had waited too
long and ended up riding by myself for the first time without quickly
catching someone or being caught. It really wasn't that fun at all, the
plains were nothing to look at all, and I had a hard time keeping my
eyes open really haha. So, I decided to do some intervals to keep myself
interested, and in doing a 1 on, 1 off, 2 on, 2 off, 3 on, 2 off, 2 on,
1 off, 1 on pyramid at 23mph into the headwind, I actually caught up
with some friends :)

There were only like 15 miles left then, and I tried to set a pace at
which I could pull them without making them work too hard, and we
cruised all the way into town at 15-16mph, and attempted to talk through
the wind riding single file, but mostly unsuccessfully trying to talk
haha.

Our hosts a Sacred Heart (our first Catholic host church) were totally
awesome and had more snacks than I knew what to do with, and drinks
already laid out for us! It was sweet. I hopped back on the bike before
changing and went to the post office, taking Kristen's thing to mail
too. I whipped through town which is a lot of fun really, cruisin
through the turns and timing the lights and drafting and such, I was
feeling good. Got to talking to the post office mail guy, and turns out
that he was into cycling and we talked about our trip and he was telling
me all about RAAM which has a checkpoint in Effingham! It was really
cool, and when it came time to pay, he said he's got it. I asked him if
he was sure, and he was, and I'm continuely amazed by the generosity of
the people we meet and the hosts who feed and house us.

On the way back I stopped by a computer store I saw on the way there,
and picked up an ethernet cable with the hope that the port would work,
and that I could probably use it later on the trip but no beans. When I
got back to the church, most had gone to shower and they were running a
last shuttle but didn't have room for one of us. I grabbed my shower
stuff and hopped back on the bike and beat them there and back haha, and
even got a little lost and got a tour of the HS here haha. Showers were
cold, but I was hot from riding around town and riding there, so it
actually felt good once I overcame the shock of the cold water.

Tonight we had an excellent dinner, and gave a presentation to our host,
hung out (threw some disc and footballs) with the youth group here and
then did our affordable housing presentations, which were good. I typed
this guy up on notepad and hopefully it'll be going up early tomorrow! I
would hope to stop in a coffee shop on the way or something, but can't
really carry the laptop with me haha. Oh, I got an idea...put it on a
flash drive...and maybe find a library! Anyway that's all for tonight,
I'm hoping to talk to Lauren soon and then hit the hay.
