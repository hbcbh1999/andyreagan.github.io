Today was a second cross country race, and I really enjoyed this one.
 Didn’t crash, and was able to ride hard which was fun.  Started out in
first but after a mile my chain dropped and the train passed me, but I
kept pushing and passed five of them for 5th place by the end.  I think
that a longer race would have favored me, really but it was good.

The ride back was long, but I rode with Ritchie and drove the last two
hours so it was a good ride.  Hangin out at the tri house for a little
while, Alex Brown let me borrow his wetsuit!! And I got a number belt
for the run at Big Lick…so I have got all the gear for sure. and I’m
pumped.

race!
