Have you ever seen the movie "No Impact Man"? It's pretty much about a
regular dude, who attempts to go a year without generating waste. As he
finds out, it's pretty dang tough in our disposable society.  And we
encourage and support this unsustainable behavior.

So, when the Town of Blacksburg requires me to pay for trash service, I
think that's not right, and a little unfair.  It's not too hard to get
down to throwing out only a grocery bag of trash every week, but there's
no incentive to do that.  It costs the fraternities down the street the
same amount to pile huge bags of aluminum cans (also perhaps the most
recyclable material around, saving about 95% of the energy by recycling)
as it would me for my meager grocery bag.

Sure, I understand some of the reasons that it is required, as I'm sure
some cheap college students would drive their pickup to a back road and
dump trash instead, or downtown could get gross looking....but hey,
guess I'm a dreamer. (or something).
