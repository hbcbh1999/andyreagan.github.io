For all of you avid andyreagan.com fans, I'm sure you noticed the new
update! Haha, I just changed (and added) to the links at the top.
Hopefully it makes things a little bit clearer, without being too
cluttered up there.

I've been cycling a lot lately, looking at making a training plan (hence
the calender page) and am even soliciting advice from John Delong, whose
race last Saturday was brutal, and I was amoung the HALF of entrants who
finished. I've been continuing to get more involved with sustainability,
transportation, and bike advocacy (all as one thing really) and my group
for ES is going to plan a community bike ride, I've been speaking with
the Director of Rec Sports, Chris Wise, trying to clear space for the
co-op on campus (whose website I just moved to www.bbc.org.vt.edu this
morning, still accessible at bikeblacksburg.org), I applied for a
Student Entreprenuership (spelling?) Grant of \$1000 for the move of a
co-op to campus. And, along with all of those things, this past weekend
I had a lot of fun as Paul Bunyan during Haloween, which is pretty much
the best holiday ever at college. You can check out Paul in all his
likeness as my profile pic on facebook haha. And on top of all of
things, I have been speding a lot of time with my girlfriend Lauren, and
things are going well :) . (I think we're going on triple date Thursday,
but I'm supposed to keep it on the DL...shhhh) haha. Well it is 2AM now,
and I think Rob is trying to sleep (well either that, or is he is
sleepingup there) so that's all I've got! OH and the new bike that I'm
getting got in Today!! I'm going to go pick up Friday, I'm pumped!
