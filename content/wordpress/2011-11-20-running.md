Provoked by Dan Z's question of why not try to run a faster marathon
than a 50 miler or ironman next year, I had the though to plot distance
and speed of running, as the two directions that I could go. Didn't turn
out quite as I expected, so I had to inverse speed. And taking Dan into
consideration, up it not only way to go on the second graph.
