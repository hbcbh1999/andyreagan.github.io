This is a draft of a letter to the editor, as part of our ES final
reflection. Still a definite work in progress, I've been adding and
cutting from it to keep it under 200 words.

I'm not going to tell you that you should eat vegan, vegetarian,
flexatarian, or whatever, to "save the environment." All I'm
challenging/proposing is that you take the effort toÂ *understand*where
your food comes from, and what your decisions to eat it mean to your
health, our local economy or the industrial agriculture system. As long
as you can be comfortable with whatever that means, then I can have no
problem with you eating a McDonald's cheeseburger for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.  
Here's one real example: When thinking about whether to drive or walk
to campus, consider that cheeseburger for breakfast. Looking closely at
the way we grow corn today, it operates on genetically modified corn,
engineered to grow in close quarters, in vast monocultures, and heavily
reliant on tons of fertilizers and pesticides (both fossil fuel based).
Then think about the tractors, the combines, the semis transporting it
and finally, the cow eating it (as today's Holstien cattle are fed
solely grain). It then takes 35 pounds of grain to make one pound of
cow.  
You'd literally burn more gas walking than driving your car an
equivalent distance, with red meat as your fuel of choice.  
Then ask yourself if this bothers you at all. If it does, as I think it
should, do your homework. I'd suggest reading Omnivore's Dilemma, by
Michael Pollan, as the best thing you'll do over break
