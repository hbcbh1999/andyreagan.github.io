Since my last post, and my decision to become a math major, things
haven't gotten any easier haha. I still have to work just as hard in
classes this semester to keep up that thing they call a GPA....darn.

What I have worked on is a schedule of what the next two years will look
like:

Here's a link to all four years, with legend and such: [Math Four Year
Plan](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/fouryearplan_math.pdf)

After next semester (those purple classes) I'll be done with everything
but straight Math! And if I want a Chemistry minor, I can add a Chem
class that is on there now.  I have a Green Eng minor in the back of my
mind...which I could try to do too, I will have some flexibility.  I
really see no reason not to graduate in three and half years, but what I
could do is this BS/MS 5-year program from the Math Dept.
