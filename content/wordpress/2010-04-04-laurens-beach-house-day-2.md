So it's late, has been a really long day and fun day of sun and driving,
so bear with me as I follow through on my promise to update the site
every day haha.

I got up real early with hopes to take a time lapse of the sunrise on
the ocean but it was suuuper foggy, so no beans there.  Lauren and her
Mom and grandparents went to the 7AM nondenominational service, I didn't
go because I was planning on going to mass later anyway, I should've
gone though haha it was only half an hour!

Yesterday we had scouted out the Catholic church, and service was at 9
and 11 so when Lauren came back from her early service we heated up some
*DELICIOUS* corncakes and apple desert from the night before, yum yum.

Mass was nice, it was outside where all the masses are there, and we
still had to stand on the railing 20 minutes early! Must've been a day
of obligation or something jeez...

Then we played some really intense games of rummikub, her grandpa
beating up on us haha, and he showed me the research that they had done
on the impacts of what he did, which was develop polymers for aviation
at NASA Langley, really neat.  Developed the very resins that I'm racing
on!

The rest of the day we spent hanging out on the beach, and while we were
down there we saw dolphins like 50 feet from shore!! They were sooo
close, I ran partly into the icy water, and could've swam right with
them....but was a little afraid to haha.  Then we reluctantly packed up
to return to the real world....and survived the 6 hour drive home,
keeping eachother going. We stopped at Cracker Barrel so I could get a
country fried steak as my (well, second) meal with meat after Lent, and
it was gooood!  We got back late, and now I'm trying to get to bed haha.

Here's some of the pictures from last night walking around the tip of
the island!
