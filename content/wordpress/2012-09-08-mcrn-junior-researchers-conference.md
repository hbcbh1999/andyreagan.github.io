The Math Climate Research Network (MCRN) was one of the things that
originally turned me on to coming to UVM to potentially work on climate
things, when I was just looking at schools. Thinking back to that, I
haven't made as great of an effort to get involved as I perhaps should
have, but this opportunity to get involved was great. I'm not sure how
much work I'm going to be doing that is relevant to this group, but I
learned a lot about what they're doing, and the Data Assimilation (DA)
definitely has some ties to a broader sense of what Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) is.

My flights were the only ones that made it down and back without an
overnight delay (Lewis 1/2, Nick 2/2 delayed overnight) so kudos to
JetBlue for pulling that one off. Stepping off of the plane into NC, the
humidity knocked me flat. Maybe I had gotten accustomed to it when I
lived down there, but the whole week I was yearning for some fresh
Vermont air. I did get out for one run, and a swim on Saturday, so I
wasn't at a total loss for training (not like I actually have a training
plan). It is hard to find time to get out with all day meetings and only
a free hour or so before a group dinner.

Some highlights included (beyond learning about the mathematics of
climate research thrusts)... the hush puppies, shuffleboard, and meeting
a great group of researchers.
