So this is going to be a short post, we're at Lyndsay McKeever's house
for the Navy race tomorrow, so here's some highlights of the week
(post-tuesday):

-got a 99 on my syntech quiz!! didn't expect that...

-used a TI-83 to make my camera take pictures at set intervals! results
of this in the coming weeks hopefully, search "stop-action photography"
for an idea of what I'm going for

-I finally listened to a CD that Lauren made me, and I really like it :)

-I did some decent training....and am psyched for this weekend!

-I didn't die trying to do two post-labs for syntech the night before
they were due...

-I finished the book Living Downstream, and the ending wasn't super but
it was definitely an interesting read

-Ben Rice and I solved the worlds energy problems on the ride here, and
decided that I am going to buy and run Hokie Spokes bike shop while I'm
teaching at Tech in a few years. Â I also might have convinced Ben to
build a HPV super aero bike for his senior design project to break the
human land speed record of 82MPH, so I can join!

-successfully avoided red meat for the week! it was easy

-made some headway on the community bike ride, briefing the SGA
Transportation Committee and giving an update about it to all of ES with
the rest of the group, [here's a
link](http://www.mapmyride.com/route/us/va/blacksburg/126126641085262875)
to the *tentative* route that I put together!

-interviewed with the CT about my Bike and Build trip this summer,
hopefully an article coming out next week!

And I am going to get 8 hours of sleep tonight!

And since everyone loves pictures and I need practice putting them in,
here are some highlight ones for the week!
