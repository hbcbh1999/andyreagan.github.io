My spring break flew by, but in short it was great being able to see my
Dad, Mom, Kyle, Carl, Dan Z, Dan K, and Del.  I drove to Philly Monday
afternoon after finishing some brewing operations and then Tuesday Del
drove up to SYR. Wednesday I spent with my dad going to appointments,
and it was good because they're getting the pain that he had in his side
to go away now.  Thursday, Del and I drove to Buffalo, picking up Zdan
along the way and went out to some bars near south campus for the night
with all the guys.  We didn't get back until late Friday, and I was
stressin about getting together a powerpoint for Tuesday (which I'm
procrastinating right now), but I did get a draft together.  Saturday,
without a car I rode my bike into SYR to watch the parade, and back home
later to see Carl.  Del and Dknick and I went back out downtown pretty
uneventfully, and then Sunday I spent all day trekking back to
Blacksburg. Now for a very busy two days (big test, big presentation
tomorrow) and then racing at ASU this weekend!
