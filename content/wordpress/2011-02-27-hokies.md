We beat Duke last night, and it was awesome.  We didn't even play that
well, but played harder than we have this whole year.  I was right in
the middle of this!!

After getting out that giant sweaty mess, which was so crazy, then I got
the trike and took Jeff, Rudy and Crowley on a parade downtown screaming
and shouting with the crowds. Sooooo fun.  All of downtown was a pretty
huge party.

I tied up the trike and went into the Cellar, the only place without a
50 person line, and Hayden and a bunch of Hillcrest people were there
which was cool.  I was super thirsty from the rediculous workout I was
getting so I went for a Schlitz as my celebration beer haha, \$1.   It
was a crazy night, watching the highlights shouting "lets go!!" and the
rest of the Rivermill chanting back "HOKIESSS!!"
