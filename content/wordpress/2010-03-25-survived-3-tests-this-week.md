It was a rough week, with tests in ES, Calculus of Several Variables,
and Organic Chemistry II, along with plenty of other assignments
(including a massively long Mass and Energy Balances HW, and Organic
Chemistry HW) and meetings!

But now that's over and there are only 5 weeks + change left in the
semester!!

Big news this week:

-   It was Lauren's birthday this week! She's 20!
-   We (as a committee) did a good chunk of the work making a new site
    for the Newman Catholic Community!
-   I only slept 15 hours the past three nights
-   I'm going to get free pizza tonight hopefully haha
-   I spoke with Dr. Sue Hagen and Dr. Bud Brown about becoming a math
    major and teaching
-   I applied for a job! As a part-time mechanic at Hokie Spokes
-   Still working hard planning a Community Bike Ride for April 23rd
-   (gasp) I didn't train on my bike at all!
-   Lauren and I went for a 5 mile ride out the huck, on her mom's bike
    that I fixed up, and it still needs some work!
-   Nuthin but NET (our intramural innertube waterpolo team) dominated
    on Tuesday, two more games to win it all

That's all for now, the class I'm typing this in is drawing to a close!
