First, I've spent hours and got up all the pictures for the past three
days and today!! Now the post:

The ride today was beautiful beyond words, riding into and through the
Rockies.  The elevation profile that I posted yesterday was a little bit
misleading as for grade, the first two hills were super steep and the
giant hill was really gradual until the end.  Looking at it now makes
sense, but it was hard to remember.

We ate breakfast with the Men’s Breakfast that the church has on Friday
mornings, and I got to talk for a good while with two awesome guys who
were excited about my trip which was really cool.  The casserole for
breakfast was awesome again.

The first two hills of the day which don’t look bad on the elevation
profile were really steep and killer!  The group I went out with caught
up with everyone and we all kinda split up.  By the time we hit the big
gradual hill I thought it was just Jesse and I out front, but Mark was
ahead of us we realized at the top.  There were a lot of cyclists out,
and the climb to Ward (mile 21) was apparently a pretty famous climb for
the area.  It was fun passing lots of people going up, the elevation
didn’t seem to be bothering us at all.  A few miles into it, a guy
passed us and so I caught up to him.  We got to talking, his name was
Terry, and he was pretty awesome.  He had biked the country self
supported in both directions, the second time carrying only 13 pounds of
gear, and had through hiked the Appalachian Trail, Continental Divide,
and Pacific Crest Trail!  Said he had lived in Boulder for 20 years now,
he worked in optics and most recently worked on the 3d glasses for
movies, which was cool.  It was neat getting to talk to him up most of
the climb, he knew a girl who rode a unicycle across the country!!

At the top was the town of Ward where we thought lunch was supposed to
be, but it was a mile down the hill after the crest.  Ward is a small
hippie town, and we met up with another cross country cycling trip
called 4K For Cancer which was neat.  Our ride is more organized for
sure, and it was cool because we’re both biking for great causes.  I
went into the general store there because I had heard about it at
breakfast that morning, and they had real Coca Cola! So of course I had
to get one.

Biking in toward the snow capped mountains and riding right next to them
was surreal.  We saw Long Peak Mountain which stood at over 14,000
feet.  We stopped for a little bit along the way just to try to soak it
in…

At mile 44 we began descending into Estes Park from \>9,000 feet, and
flying into town on the side of a mountain with an awesome view of the
snow capped peaks right next to us was beyond words.  Emily and Kristen
cried it was so beautiful on the way in.  It was probably the single
most beautiful 5 minutes of my entire life, I can't even describe.
 There were no words.

In town, I stopped and ate pizza with Jesse and Zach at this good place
Jesse knew, got a deep dish cheese and it was pretty good.  From there,
I saw Heather and Jen and Alyson get into town and we went and checked
out the Stanley Hotel.  It’s where “The Shining” took place, it’s a
fancy hotel really, and they have ghost tours!

Our host tonight was a high school about 5 miles out of town that is
also an anomaly.  The campus was way out in the mountains with a
gorgeous view on 640 acres, and turns out that it's a Honda sponsored
boarding school that serves to help struggling high schoolers across the
nation and as a lab for new teaching methods! Students apply, and the
estimated \$40,000 yearly tuition is covered by Honda and they spend a
minimum of two years, the first 25 days are a wilderness retreat and
it's a pretty sweet school.  I found out at about 11 that they had
internet, and got to post this that I have been writing!

And so I've put together elevation profiles for the next three days for
the group and got closer to getting pix up for the past few days but
unlike the first line haha I don't think I'll finish, it's midnight now
and we have a big day tomorrow on Trail Ridge Road.  I'm going to save
the elevation to put at the top of that post, but it looks like one big
uphill to the top, and one steady downhill.

Oh almost forgot to mention that today, I snapped my front derailer
cable! I couldn't shift into my big ring (which I don't need uphill
anyway) and had to just coast down hills for the remainder of the ride.
Since I didn't need the derailer without the cable, at lunch I took the
cable out and decided to take the derailer off so it wouldn't rub in the
cross ring gears.  I broke my chain by hand to take it off and put it
back together.  For the next few miles it was shifting like crap, and
the chain broke while I was riding! I stopped, and very luckily the
master links had stayed on, or I would have been out a chain.  I put it
back together better this time, and was good for the rest of the day.

Ok well that's all for now, goodnight!
