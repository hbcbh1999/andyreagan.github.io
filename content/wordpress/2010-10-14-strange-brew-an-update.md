Mine and Dave's attempt at brewing beer has moved to the next stage.
 After sitting a week too long in the primary fermentation, it was about
time.  I borrowed Elliot's racking cane, bucket, and tubes and went to
work cleaning the bottles.

Cleaning out used beer bottles is probably the least fun part of the
process, but it wasn't bad at all.  After that, I boiled slightly more
than a half cup of maple syrup with a cup of water, put it in the bottom
of the racking bucket, and added the beer from carboy \#1.  The smell of
the boiling syrup was awesome, and brought Dave back some good memories.
 From there, we discovered that the bucket valve had a small leak and
after losing not too much beer, went to work putting it in bottles.
 That didn't take too long, we used up 25 bottles and then putting the
caps on is one of my favorite parts.

I cleaned out that carboy, to use it as a vessel for the secondary
fermentation of the other half of strange brew, with a bunch of maple
syrup.  Cleaning it out was a pain, but I did it, put the syrup in, and
racked from the other carboy.  I cleaned out that one too, for good
measure.  Airlocked and hopefully fermenting again, it's sitting in the
kitchen with my sleeping bag around it.  Right now, less than 24hrs in,
I see a bubble every 20sec or so.  Here's pictures from the process:
