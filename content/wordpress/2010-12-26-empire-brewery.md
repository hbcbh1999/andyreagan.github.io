On Wednesday, Tim of Empire Brewery gave my Dad and I a tour of the
brewery.  It's not something he normally does, but he read my email
about this being a father-son Christmas present and couldn't turn me
down.

The tour was awesome.  We got there and had some delicious burgers while
we waited for him to finish cleaning up from brewing a double batch, and
then went back to see the inner workings.

I'm not sure how much I should divulge, but I don't think it's a hidden
secret that they capacity to brew 7 barrels, and have 7-7-7-14-14
barrel fermenters.  He brews double batchs of the two most popular
(sadly, the lightest two beers, but they are both very good...the flavor
of the Skinny Atlas really shocked my Dad and I for a light beer) into
the 14 barrel fermenters, and the other ferment the other beers.  Tim
really gave us some great information about how he came to be a brewer,
how the brewery operates, and what it means to be a small craft brewer
in 2010.  He's really nothing short of an artist, and his craft has to
suit all of those who come to the bar.

I really can't say enough about the tour, we walked away with 2 pounds
of local hops, and samples of NY grains, a growler, and bellies full of
great beer.  An all around awesome experience.
