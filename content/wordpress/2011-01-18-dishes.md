Slug: dishes

Coming back to a messy house made me realize why people clean before
they leave, after a long a trip the last thing any of us wanted to do
was clean.  The biggest problem was the heaping pile of dishes in the
sink...and we were trying to think of ways so that this doesn't happen
all the time.  I did all the dishes, and vacuumed the floors, and told
Dave and James that was the last time I was doin that shit.  We needed
something.

As a sort of joke, I told them what my Dad said he and his roommate in
college did when they had the same problem with dishes...they put away
everything but on dish per person so if you needed it, you had to clean
it.  Dave actually took to that idea, and that's what we decided to do.
 After two days, it's been working perfect aka no big pile of dishes
yet.

I actually like it a lot now, because rather than having cupboards full
of dishes and glasses, there's just one and it's easy.  Here's a picture
of our cupboard now, and the delicious venison chili, and a berry pie
Emily made.
