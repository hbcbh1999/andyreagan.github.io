In the morning, about 6 hours from now, I'll be headed down to Virginia
Tech to start my third year, driving down with my girlfriend Lauren.
 I've spent right about two weeks recovering and having withdrawals from
this summer on Bike and Build at home in Marcellus, NY and have spent
most of my days sleeping in and drinking around a bonfire haha.  Lauren
came up on the 14th and I have really enjoyed showing her around my home
town, more like eating around my home town, and I think/hope she has had
fun too.

For the first while I was back, I did manage to ride my bike after
sleeping in till noon every day but with playing basketball with my dad
and spending time with Lauren this most recent week, I've got a chance
to spend this past week out of the saddle.  Every day it's weird because
I feel like I should be riding, and just have the urge to ride my bike
all the time...adjusting to the real world where not every day is a 70
mile day haha.

I've tried to take some pictures of what I've been up to, and played
some with my new 50mm f1.8 lens as well, which I really like.  So here's
what I got:
