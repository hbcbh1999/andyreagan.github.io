Today was the longest, and by far the hilliest day yet, and the riding
was the most beautiful I have EVER done. We started bright and early
with a 5AM wake-up call, but weren't leaving the house until our usual
7:30 because there was a lot of cleaning and packing up to be done,
since we had been there for three days.  We headed out some beautiful,
rolling country roads on over to a mountain, up that mountain and onto
the *very* hilly and VERY beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway.  We started the
day at 750ft above sea level, undulated and climbed to 2500, kept
climbing to 3300, then back to 2200, up to 3200, back down...and again
and again haha. I was in awe of the scenery all day, loved climbed and
jumping in the river here in Lexington was the most refreshing thing
ever.

I have a record number, 54!!, pictures today! Some of the them are a few
days old, and those will be first, enjoy!

After that we ate some clif shots in preparation for the big climb,
which I hit hard from the bottom and was by myself at the top off.  Mark
wasn't far behind, and neither were Emma or Zach so we rode back to them
and kept on going.  The climb had been hyped up for the past few days
and people were freaking out a little, but it was probably comparable to
Harding, just maybe a little steeper.  The down side of going on up so
quick was that I missed the Cookie Lady though...dissappointing.

Perhaps the best moment of the trip was reaching that very first scenic
overlook:

We kept going up and down these massive climbs, and my endorphins were
going crazy, we were all pretty high on life biking through the
mountains.

We got off the parkway on US-60, taking a 6 mile descent into the
beautiful little town of Lexington, VA.  The descent was so steep that I
was going over 50MPH (the only one in our group to hit it, thanks to the
aerobars and full-size cranks!) for like a whole mile, absolutely
cruising through the turns at 45.

After it leveled out, we were still hot and saw a very inviting river,
and since we were the first group decided to take a swim!
