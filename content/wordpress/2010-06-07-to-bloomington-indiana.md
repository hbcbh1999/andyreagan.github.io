Today we got to sleep in until 6:30 which was great...and I was on the
couch which was awesome too, laid in bed for an extra 15 minutes as well
haha love that feeling that you're tired and want to sleep while laying
down. Anyway, the ride today was only 41 miles which everyone was very
excited for, and there was an awesome town on the way (Nashville), and
Bloomington (home of Indiana University) is really really cool.

We started out slow, and I pulled into the wind for awhile which was
good because I can pedal hard and get to help out other people! There
were still some inclines along the way, but no real big ones and we made
great time. About halfway on our ride we got to Nashville, and we
stopped at a super cool coffee shop and got some fudge!

Then we hopped on over to the fudge store where the "fudge never melts"!
I'm 99.9% sure it would in my back jersey pocket haha

Nashville was such a super cool town, soo many little shops it would be
easy to spend a day there for sure.  Riding out of Nashville was nice
too

Lunch was about 30 miles in, at the top of a small hill that Dave and I
sprinted up being chased by a dog haha.  I got to eat the leftover
enchiladas from the night before which were *awesome*!!

Rolling into Bloomington we rode by the university and I saw fountains
on campus, so of course we had to get in them!

We got into the host which is a HUGE church right in the downtown, and I
got to shower again right away, score!

being a salesman and knowing someone from the local brewery told them
about us and got them to give us all free drinks (except for us
youngin's
though....)"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0137-300x200.jpg "IMG_0137")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0137.jpg)[/caption]

After dinner, I realllly wanted to go find the[Little
500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_500)track so I headed out on my
bike to explore because that's always fun.  Bloomington is one of the
nicest college towns we've been in, I enjoyed it a lot, and the campus
was gorgeous as well.

caption="Just look at this campus. I think I also really liked being by
myself for once, and exploring on bike is just super fun. I needed the

think"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0146-300x200.jpg "IMG_0146")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0146.jpg)[/caption]

I ran into a teacher at the university, and asked how to get to the
track and ended up talking to her about cycling, (she was on a bike and
commutes on one) and what I am doing and it was cool.  I had to ask
another guy before I found it haha.  I was amazed by the castle-sized
frats here, they are rediculous!

caption="The track was really neat. It was finely ground cinder, so
almost like riding in an inch of sand! I couldn't imagine trying to go
fast around these bends, no chance on a road bike at
all"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0162-300x200.jpg "IMG_0162")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0162.jpg)[/caption]

And then I came back and we walked over the brewery for free beer (free
water for me haha) and it was pretty cool.

And that was the day!! A really long day for such a short ride, but
after my campus cruising I logged over 50 miles.  Tomorrow I should
break 1000! I'll end with my favorite picture of the way, the view from
my handlebars:
