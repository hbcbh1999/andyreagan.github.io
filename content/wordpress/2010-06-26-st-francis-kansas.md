Today we rode 70 miles through blistering heat (the bank said 106) and a
stiff headwind to our final stop in Kansas. The riding went well, our
hosts were again spectacular with dinner, and we got to bowl for free!

I'm writing from my phone now but I got pictures for when we get
internet and stuff!

Today the riding was a little less exciting, but despite the lack of
scenery and scorching heat it was another great day! The temperature
reached 106F, and I rode pretty fast all day to try to beat the heat
into town.  I finished the day with 71 miles of riding, watched the
world cup game, showered and bought an outfit at the thrift store, ate,
talked to Lauren, and bowled!

Early on I started with the “Hold Me Love Me” chore group, and Mark, but
that group didn’t stay together for very long.  I ended up riding more
quickly with Mark and Noah, and after a little while Tio and Mark and I
took off.  Lunch was nice at about 36 miles, and I ate quick to head out
with the first group.  Joe, Tio, Sarah G, Mark and I were the first out,
but in a mile or so it was just Mark and I.  We were facing a pretty
stiff headwind all day, but Mark and I set a nice even pace that we held
for the next 35 miles straight.

We passed through two towns during the ride, distinguished from the
landscape with towering grain elevators.  This northwestern part of
Kansas has actually been the flattest."
