Today began bright and early at 6AM with packing, breakfast from our
host church, and then to the wheel dip ceremony before we headed out!

Here is the day in pictures:

I set off from there with Mark, who was ready to get this show on the
road.  I managed the group's first flat tire about TWO MILES down the
road, and we found a big ol' chunk of glass in my rear wheel, thank VA
Beach! Got it changed quick though and we were on our way.  Mark and I
kept cruisin, starting at the very back after the flat, and caught up to
all but the lead group by the time we stopped for lunch, which was about
27 miles in.

one to get a flat today, and I got two! Just bad luck I guess, though

comfortable changing them. In another 10 minutes we were
off"][![](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/flat2-300x200.jpg "flat2")](http://andyreagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/flat2.jpg)[/caption]

And then we got shuttled over to the YMCA to shower, and are just
hanging out (blogging) before dinner!

A great day so far, one thing I know for sure: I'm going to sleep like a
baby!
