I'm at work, so this won't be too long...On Tuesday, Bonesaw remained
undefeated at volleyball, and possibly looking into joining the more
competitive Pine Grove league. Wednesday, I stayed in with my family and
Jean, it being her last day here and probably the last time she will
make the trip to NY. Like she said, both of us will be starting new
decades this year, her's being the 80's and mine being the 20's. Man, I
can't believe I'm turning 20. Ok, well I can believe it, but it's still
weird...But I'm doing everything that I want to be doing and really
couldn't be much happier about it.

Tonight is the first week of the 3v3 basketball league at the park, I'm
pretty excited for it. Our team consists of Me, my Old Man, Del, John
Ellis, and one of Ellis' friends, who is a gaurd. With that crew, I was
thinking we should name the team something along the lines of the
"demolition squad." I'll let all y'all know how that goes. Lunch time!
