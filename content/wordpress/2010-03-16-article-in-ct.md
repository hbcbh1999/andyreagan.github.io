##### More general update

In other news concerning my life, I got a 92 on my Mass and Energy exam,
which was extra exciting considering the class average was a 65.5...and
Experimental Organic Chemistry Synthesis and Techniques lab is still
sucking my life (so much time and work), but today was really good!

Yesterday I drove up to Roanoke with Brett and got some new bar tape for
my bike, all white, it looks sick! [Here's a
twitpic](http://tweetphoto.com/14540983) of it, but that doesn't do it
any justice.

I went for a long ride Sunday, like 53 miles and I really overdid
it...my knee started hurting a lot on the way back...so I'm going to
stay off it, not race this weekend and take it from there!

And I'm getting ready for the battering of tests I have next week, with
a test Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday....ugh
