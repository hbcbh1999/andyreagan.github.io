So clippers met hair, and I decided to finally cut off my long hair. I'm
pretty happy with the decision, washing it is SOO much better (I don't
really have to) and it's not in my eyes! Still wish I could flip a
switch between long and short, but don't we all...

I'll let the pictures do the talking:

And then after a few days it always looks a little better than fresh
from the clippers, and this is the hard earned shirt that you can read
about in the previous post!

And somehow in the two hours I spent outside yesterday I got fried, it
was nice though, our professor in ES let us have discussion outside in
the perfect sunny and 80F weather.

I'm trying out the scheduled publish feature, and so this should be
going up at 11:00 and I'll be on the way to Lauren's beach house for the
weekend!

#### New goal

Since I'm already 2 for 2, I'm going to try to blog everyday this
month!! Hopefully I don't run out of interesting things to day...or have
I already?
