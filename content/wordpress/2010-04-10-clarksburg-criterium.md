There is no way to hide a lack of training in a city block criterium,
and I certainly wasn't able to.

I didn't have high expectations, but it's still really hard not being
able to get on the break, and suffering on the wheel of the "chase"
group, when weeks ago I would've been crushing it in the break.  Not
sure where I finished, don't really care at moment, not point-worthy for
sure (15th maybe?).  I'm blaming it on myself here, but I did get
23.5MPH for my *average* speed, which is crushing with the tight turns
and small hills, above my TT pace haha.  Having cadence was nice, I
noticed that I liked to go at about 110 the whole race! Missed
[Brett](http://mydailyground.com) at the race this weekend too!

On a positive note, Jean and Don and my parents came down for the race!!
And the weather and race were awesome, it was right in the downtown, set
up awesome, and I got four free hamburgers lol, as well as a few free
ones for my dad and mom! It was great to see them again after so long :)

The cycling team's hotel was pretty sketchy, (6 people per small,
smelly-ish room), and I opted to stay with my parents tonight after
having Zach cuddle with me and snore like a freight train 6 inches from
my face haha, got one of the worst nights sleep in a long time haha.
 Much improved haha in a Hilton that is HUGE and my own bed.  We got
dinner tonight, and it was really good, and we caught up on all that
we've been up to.

With my evident lack of training and/or fitness, I'm just going to relax
in the road race tomorrow and not try anything crazy (other than to
finish!).  Congrats to [Reid](http://bigwatts.blogspot.com), Matt
Dockins, and Ben Rice for strong finishes in the A, B and C fields
respectively!
