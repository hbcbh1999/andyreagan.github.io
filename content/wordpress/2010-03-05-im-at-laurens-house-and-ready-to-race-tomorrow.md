The trip today went well, although packing was a little hectic and my
room arrangements for Break got shuffled around, it all worked out!
 Nick Waugh's landlord freaked out...told him it would've been a
violation of the lease and that she would call the cops if we were
there...so I talked to David Henry and Arturo and I are going to crash
on the couch there, no worries!  And I had realized a little last minute
that I wouldn't be able to get back in the dorms Sunday...so we had to
run stuff that I'll need for next week out to my car.  I was going to
have Reid take my bike, and ride it over there, but I got my bike rack
out of my car for Lauren in case she needed it to bring her bike back,
since Rob was planning on coming back from break with her too, and we
put it on the back of her car just for somewhere to put it...and then I
just ended up putting my bike on and we brought it that way!

I really wish that tomorrow was the road race, because I'm ready to
race! But, I'll just have to save it for Sunday.  I don't wanna kill
myself in the time trial...winning is pretty anti-climatic in a time
trial.

Lauren did a good job driving, with my bike and all, and her house is
nice! Her dad had four steaks ready to cook, and just to go along, I
opted out of my Lenten sacrifice for one night.  [Here's a link to a pic
of the poor bike haha.](http://tweetphoto.com/13337423)

### Thursday

I totally killed the paper that I had due Thursday, the [ES Literature
Review
Report](http://ecbiz83.inmotionhosting.com/~andyre5/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ld_report_reagan_3_4_10.docx)! A
summary of the studies of BPA and human health.  On the whole, very
damning, and it's amazing that we still produce 6 pounds of this stuff
for every American every year, it can be found in 92% of our urine and
clearly linked to many problems!

The test that I had also been stressing about Thursday night went well,
but I don't wanna speak too soon haha! But I'm sure I did fine.

That's all for now, as I said in my twitter, I have a day of racing,
going on a recovery ride with Lauren bc the weather should be beautiful,
shopping for clothes for next week, and then watching a movie!!
