Title: A record that needs breaking
Date: 2016-09-29

It's been about 5 years since I first stumbled across the Human Powered Land Speed [World] Record, and the competition for the record is certainly stiff.
It just got broken a [couple weeks ago](http://www.redbull.com/us/en/bike/stories/1331751185607/human-powered-speed-record-holder-interview) with a run of 89MPH!!

Looking through the records, I had originally noticed that the tandem record is _slower_ than the single person record...and since top speed is simply a matter of power overcoming drag, it should be faster!
Here's the [record](http://www.ihpva.org/hpvarecl.htm#nom12) and some description of the [most recent event they had](http://www.recumbents.com/wisil/whpsc2016/speedchallenge.htm), for breaking records.

I was able to find some details on the [current record holder](http://www.recumbents.com/wisil/lem/glowworm/default.htm), the [one before that](http://www.easyracers.com/racing.html), and [from the 70's](https://books.google.com/books?id=_VEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=Vector+Tandem+al+voigt&source=bl&ots=I3brPbY16P&sig=8yxEvzYR3oYv8JAuGGcFdVnuXj0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiplrmkp7XPAhUKLyYKHdZnDZoQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=Vector%20Tandem%20al%20voigt&f=false).

The back-to-back seems like an odd choice, but perhaps it makes the most since.
Either way, I'd love to take a shot at this one.
