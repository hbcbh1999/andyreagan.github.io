Title: Officially a Ph.D candidate!
Date: 2015-01-26

I've just recieved word of my passing the ODE/PDE qual, my third and final big qualifying exam.
The exam was very difficult but I had studied for three months and was able to stumble my way through.

Now, the plan is to finish classes this semester (taking 3!) and then write some papers as a first author!
