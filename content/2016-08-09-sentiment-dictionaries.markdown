Title: Sentiment dictionary roundup
Date: 2016-08-09
Status: draft

Found the data for WNA from a link at the bottom of:
http://www.gelbukh.com/emosenticnet/
which was dead, but a google search for the filename took me to:
https://github.com/yung-ethan/Twitter_Emotional_Content/tree/master/sentiment%20lexicons
which has the file.

Not sure if EmoSentic{Net,Space} are different.
The dataset is titled the former, but the 2014 paper has the latter title.

ISEAR can be found here:
