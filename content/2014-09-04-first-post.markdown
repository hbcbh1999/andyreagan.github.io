Title: Github pages with Pelican
Date: 2014-09-04

If I get this on github pages, it will be a miracle.

So, I did. Here's how.

1. Note the date on this post, things may have changed.
2. Be ready with homebrew (on your Mac) and a github account.

Install virtualenv (with pip).

Create a new directory, i.e. "website", and start a virtual environment.
I use autoenv (brew install autoenv), which executes a .env file if it exists when you change into a directory.
Autoenv will ask you to confirm the .env file is correct.

    :::bash
    cd website
    virtualenv pyenv
    echo "source /Users/andyreagan/website/pyenv/bin/activate" > .env
    cd .

Now your prompt should be prefixed by "(pyenv)". Now start installing pelican.

    :::bash
    pip install pelican
    pip install markdown
    pip install ghp-import
    

If you're going to migrate over posts from somewhere else (wordpress for me), get pandoc.

    :::bash
    brew install pandoc


Now you can get started building the website with Pelican. First, make sure the github is set up. Follow the instructions on https://pages.github.com/, and leave the repository empty.
Clone it into your working directory (website) with

    :::bash
    git clone https://github.com/andyreagan/andyreagan.github.io .

Finally, build the website with Pelican. I just followed the tutorial on their documentation, which is excellent: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/quickstart.html

Once you've got something showing in localhost, it's time to push it up to github. Hold your breath.
The publishing script that I use, very simple is:

    :::bash
    # publishsimple.sh
    
    pelican content -s pelicanconf.py 
    ghp-import output
    git push -f origin gh-pages:master

Some other goodies. All of this is well documented within Pelican's docs, but here it is. This is the tail of my pelicanconf.py:

    :::py
    # static paths will be copied without parsing their contents
    STATIC_PATHS = [
        'images',
        'files',
        ]
    
    # get a homepage on the menu bar
    MENUITEMS = [("Home","/index.html",),]
    
    # make the URL's look nice
    ARTICLE_URL = '{date:%Y}/{date:%m}/{date:%d}/{slug}/'
    ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = '{date:%Y}/{date:%m}/{date:%d}/{slug}/index.html'
    YEAR_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS = '{date:%Y}/index.html'
    MONTH_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS = '{date:%Y}/{date:%b}/index.html'

And I did fork my own theme. Copied over the theme from "pyenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pelican/themes/simple/templates/" into "theme/finnigan".
I also created the "static" folder alongside "templates," and put the "css" and "js" and "images" folders inside static.

Then set this to be the theme in "pelicanconf.sh":

    :::py
    THEME='theme/finnigan'

If you've made it this far, start writing!

Cheers!
