Title: Burlington Generator
Date: 2015-01-24

After enacting [part 1](https://twitter.com/andyreagan/status/558726551379136512) and [part 2](https://twitter.com/andyreagan/status/558775826703855618) of my PhD qualifying exam recovery plan, I spent Saturday exploring Burlington's new makerspace.
There is a lot of info about the space on their [website](http://generatorvt.com/).

As UVM students, Curtis Saunders and I are enjoying a free membership through the exchange program.
I'm really looking forward to using the space for some projects that I've been thinking about!
First up: a sign for Sam and a proper trophy for the Storylab Strava leaderboard.
