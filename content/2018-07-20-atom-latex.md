Title: Writing LaTeX in Atom
Author: Andy Reagan
Date: 2018-07-20

Atom is a code editor.
The defaults try to "complete" words from your writing, and don't highlight spelling.
After many months of using a code editor to write,
it's clear that I've gone backwards and I should at least be using spell checking!

These two settings vastly improve the latex experience in Atom:

## Add latex to spellcheck file types.

Go to the `spell-check` package settings (itâ€™s a core package), and add `text.tex.latex` to the list of languages.

Here's the reference that guided me: [https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-enable-spell-checking-for-another-language/4895/12](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-enable-spell-checking-for-another-language/4895/12)

## Turn off autocompletion in latex files.

Go to the `autocomplete-plus` package (also a core package) and add `*.tex` to the blacklist of file types.

## Happy TeXing!
