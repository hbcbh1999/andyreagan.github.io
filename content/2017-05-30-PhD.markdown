Title: Call me Doctor :)
Date: 2017-05-20

Today I have completed my PhD at the University of Vermont, earning a Doctorate in Applied Mathematics along with a Certificate of Study in Complex Systems.
I can't offer enough thanks to my advisors, Peter Dodds and Chris Danforth, as well as my family and my wife, Sam.
