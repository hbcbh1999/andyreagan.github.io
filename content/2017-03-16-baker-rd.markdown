Title: Home sweet Home
Date: 2017-03-16

Today, my wife and I took another step towards adulthood and closed on our first home.
Or, as I like to remind myself, the bank just bought another house and is letting us have the privilege of living in it and paying them interest to do so.
It was a bit of a wild ride, with Sam's train down to the closing from Burlington being delayed by the snow storm, and our closing being pushed back a day.
But signing the papers was simple (compared to what we'd heard!), many thanks to our attorney Donna Reidy, our realtor Chuck Berube, and our bank representative Gary Talbot.
If you are looking for recommendations, these people were great and I'd be happy to put you in touch.

Before I get started ranting about amortization schedules and property taxes, I have some decks that need to be stained!
