<p>This was an incredible experience.</p>
<p>The crowds were just amazing,
and seeing my son Olson at mile 6 in the rain and cold was amazing.
With the weather, Olson on my mind, and the huge crowds, parts of the race were very emotional.</p>
<p>At about mile 11-13, I sped up to stay warm at Marc's suggestion with a tight back,
he had to hold off.
I felt like I was flying for the next 10 miles,
cruised over the rollers, and was passing ~3,000 runners over this hour.
Turns out, I didn't speed up much at all,
it must have been everyone else slowing down!</p>
<p>I really had to hang on for the finish,
and got a PR in 2:59:41!</p>
<h2>Core body temp report</h2>
<p>Started dropping 7:30am waiting in tents for the race,
dropped a lot more 9-10am outside in the rain pre-race,
and then I mostly warmed up during the first 6 miles which I had a thick rain jacket.</p>
<p>Tossed that and basically maintained a good temp through the end.</p>
<p>After the race,
soaked and shuffling through finish area,
started to get bad.
I got really cold (as did very many) in that time,
and remained cold outside for about two hours before getting a ride to a friendâ€™s apartment to shower.
Was maybe warmed back up by 4pm (3 hours after finishing).</p>
<h2>Recovery</h2>
<p>Happened slowly and was aided by an IPA-fueled afterparty at home.</p>
