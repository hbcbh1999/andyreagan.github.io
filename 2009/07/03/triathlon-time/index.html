    <p>As you may have guessed, I officially decided that I'm going to do a
triathlon at the end of the summer. After riding the trainer yesterday
and then going for a run, and having swam on Monday, I think that I will
be able to train enough to do at least a sprint triathlon. I went for a
longer bike ride today, and it was a really good ride. Got out with the
aerobars on and the spinergy front wheel, went really fast and it felt
really good. I stopped and talked to Meghan for a while...and then I saw
Kaelyn turning on to Frank Gay and talked to her for a good 20 min. She
was on her way to go for a run with Anne and she said that her and Mary
Powers were thinking about doing a triathlon at the end of the summer
too. And that took the trouble out of finding one for me...the Caz Tri
is on Aug. 16, so I should still be around that weekend! I talked to
Galileo and I'm going to need to leave to go down on the 20th it looks
like, they said that I need to be like settled by noon on the 21st...I
think I may have gone down even earlier last year... I'm pretty excited
about this year too! There is going to be soo much work...but I think if
I make a call or two I can get my schedule fixed, which will be good.</p>
<p>I'm might even create a fbook group for all of the Marcellus people that
are going to do the Caz Tri haha, I think it would be me, Kaelyn, Kaity,
Mary Powers....hmm I thought there were more haha. Maybe Anne will do it
too haha. I think that would be fun, having people to train with would
be awesome! Oh, I almost forgot Carrie!! She could def do it.</p>
<p>So me and Dan Z are gonna go to Kaelyn's tonight, the fireworks on the
lake should be sweet! And Jack's is tomorrow night...</p>
<p>Dan thinks that I should make shirts to advertise my site haha.</p>
