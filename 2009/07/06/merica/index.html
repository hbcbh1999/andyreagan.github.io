    <p>I just changed the classification of this blog from that of a "blog" to
a "journal." So, I still need to update the link on other pages...but I
definitely think that this is more of a "journal" than a blog, for sure.
I looked up the difference, which is that blogs are typically less about
the writer and more about other events and linking to information,
almost like news. Well, this is definitely not that, since I pretty much
just write about myself haha. I am still planning a "blog" entry on
libertarianism and some others that I forgot about at the moment that I
think would classify as more blog-style entries. But yeah, now, you're
officially reading a journal!</p>
<h4>The Weekend: Sun's out, guns out....Stars out, cigars out.</h4>
<p>Let me start out by saying that I rode my bike every day Thursday
through Sunday, which is a pretty good start back into training. And
that I came up with the latter rule in this title, both of which I
followed at some point. Thursday I rode on the trainer, since it was
raining, and I ended up doing an out and back on Frank Gay for a
cool-down since the rain had let up, and then ran up and down the street
a few times, totalling like 2.5miles running. It was funny, every time I
ran/biked by Del's house, Sarah yelled my name and I waved back but I
don't think she ever saw me wave b/c she kept yelling every time haha.
Then Thursday night the usual gang hung out at Del's, Hannah was there
with Dan and she didn't talk much but I think she had fun too. Friday I
fit in an extended-Pleasant Valley loop bike ride, taking Frank Gay to
Howlett to Cervale through the 13 curves to Pleasant Valley as usual,
but feeling ambitious went up Stevens to Seal and back Slate Hill. Then
from the village, instead of going up the Turnpike or Howlett, I took
the Gorge to that road that connect to Munro below the big hill, which
is a really nice road to ride on, and took that to Munro, up the "big"
hill on Munro, and Frank Gay home. I think that map would definitely
help haha. I stopped to talk to Meghan about possibly heading to
Geneseo/Letchworth this weekend, and might've helped her dad fix her
bike, but I don't think I did much lol. Then I saw Kaelyn driving, as I
was about to turn left onto the Turnpike from Frank Gay she was turning
onto FG, and so she stopped and we talked for like 20 minutes, even
though I knew Zdan was already at my house for my "cookout" haha. I
think I talked about a lot of this in my last blog about triathlon,
actually....wait, I mean my last "entry" haha. But yeah then me and Dan
went to Kaelyn's that night and she had some awesome fireworks, even
though she said that they weren't gonna be that cool this year. I know
that last year at her grad party I was like blown away... it is pretty
cool how the whole lake does the campfire around the lake thing and they
do fireworks all around on the 3rd. Saturday, my bike "ride" wasn't so
much of a training ride as it was a means of transportation. I rode down
to the Park for BP09, which was a "bust" with only 8 people, but it was
fun even though it wasn't a huge party...we ended up going up to Kyle
Blackmer's house to grill and hang out by his pool. After biking up New
Seneca and Limeledge, jumping in that pool felt great! At about 3, I
headed out and biked over to Steph Bingham's grad party and hung out
there for awhile before biking home and going to Jack's. I think that
altogether I put in about 15 miles just biking around town, so I guess
it saved me like \$2!! Jack's was a ton of fun, with Slade and Shields
there. A lot of his ACP, Albany College of Pharmacy, friends were there
and they were pretty cool. And nothing beats being able to walk home and
spend the night in my own bed...Shields slept in our guest bed too. I
told Slade that he could probably grab a couch if he wanted but he was
fine with his car haha. And then Sunday, I slept in till 11:30, which is
definitely a record for the past few months. I went to mass, and then
for a 38 mile ride around Otisco Lake, taking well more than 2 hours
this time. I met a guy named Bob who I caught up to going along the east
side of the lake, and talked to him for 7 miles or so, before I took
off. I wish more of my closer friends biked, but I think that the
"Marcellus Tri Club" fbook group that I decided I'm going to create may
give me some people to ride with! The only guy I thought of who might do
it is Dan Z, I suppose Shields could too but he'd be gone for the race,
and I guess I'm not sure that he can run. So other than that bike ride,
I didn't really do anything at all Sunday...got to bed at 10ish but it
still sucked getting up this morning, ugh. Well I suppose that's it for
the weekend, Steph said that she might try to do a bonfire thing tonight
and I suppose I'll go to that if Dan can come. I brought my swim stuff
today too, so I think I'll probably be stopping by the pool on my way
home!</p>
