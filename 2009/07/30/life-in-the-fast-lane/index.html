    <p>A lot has happened since my how-to-website on the 22nd, including my
birthday! I'm now 20 years old! The big two-oh! So I guess this is gonna
be a quick summary...</p>
<h4>My Birthday</h4>
<p>It would be fair to say that I got to celebrate my birthday THREE times!
Which was awesome. First, Friday at work Jill had baked me a cake, and
everybody signed a card, and Emma sang me Happy Birthday! The cake was
delicious and the card was really nice, so thanks guys!! Birthday #2
was that night with the regular crew (minus Del and Sarah). Right after
I got out of work, me and Slade and Shields went and fufilled what had
been lots of just talk, and jumped off a bridge and into Seneca River.
Facebook is full of picuters, I'll put a one up here too sometime. Us
three met Zdanowski, Hannah, Knickerbocker, and Lindsey for dinner at
Tullys, where I ate >17 tenders and still had to buy cigars. Ya see, I
ordered 15, like always, but it did look like a lot this time and
everyone for some reason thought that I could never eat that much. And
as I struggled to eat the last 5, I didn't think I would either. Which
was odd, since I always order and eat 15. Since it had become a
challenge, I tried my best to eat all 15, and the deal was that if I
couldn't, I would buy everyone cigars. And I just couldn't bring myself
to eat that last tender, the sundae couldn't have helped...but anyway I
bought everyone cigars for the ensuing bonfire at my house, and it
really about worked out bc they paid for my dinner. It wasn't until at
the bonfire that Zdanowski confessed to adding many tenders to my plate,
and that I actually ate like 17 or 18!! Jeez... the bonfire was really
fun...many games of never have I ever took place, and the nice cigar
that Dan and Lindz got me for my birthday was good...and I slept in till
like 10 the next day, which was great.</p>
