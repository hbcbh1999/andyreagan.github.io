    <h4>Friday</h4>
<p>Work is work, and 40 hour weeks are the worst. Friday marked the
conclusion of my fourth week of work! Really hard to believe that I have
been home for over four weeks! But, I haven't been home all that time
either, having road tripped one weekend to Toronto and travelled for one
of my races to Corning. The highlight of the day may have been my Mom
making omelets in the morning haha.</p>
<p>Friday night, we had a dudes night of sorts at Del's house, which was a
lot of fun. It was me, Del, Zdan, and Knickerbocker. Sarah was there for
a little but she headed out after her friends weren't coming. Without
gasoline, it would've been a toss up if we were going to have a fire or
not, and man that stuff is fun to play with. Put some on the wood, and
lead a little trail out to start it, and phooom the whole thing lights
up. Problem is, it would do that and then go right out the first few
times...we actually had to get some wood smaller than logs haha.</p>
<h4>Saturday</h4>
<p>I heard about the village of Marcellus having a big yard sale from my
Mom reading the paper on Thursday I think, and where better to find an
old toaster? I had been telling Megan G. that we were gonna hang out, so
I took her down the big yard sales to help me find a toaster...and even
though she was pretty convinced that I wouldn't find one, I found the
perfect toaster over from, of all people, Andy Caster's mom, and it was
only \$5, perfect, but I did carry their basketball pole from the
backyard out to the driveway haha. Small world...only problem now though
is that the toaster is rated at 1440 watts! There's absolutely no way
that I can make that much power for an extended period of
time...especially with the inefficiency of a car alternator. What I need
to do is figure out how it works, and hook it up to my P3 power meter
and see how much power it actually consumes. But now all I need is the
alternator, and important selection, and some wiring and such. I think I
might go to an outlet from the alternator so I can both use my power
meter and not destroy the toaster power cord. If this toaster toasts a
piece of bread in 2-3 minutes normally, I think for me to toast it in 15
would be pretty good. The idea of the bike-powered toaster is to take
that 30 minute morning warm up bike and make something useful from it,
so really anything under 30 would be a success.</p>
<p>After the yard sales, we came back to my house and watched "The Big
Lebowski.' I'd heard good things about it, it got an 8.2/10 on imdb, and
it was good, but perhaps less than I was expecting. Maybe I need to
watch it again haha. Me and my Dad decided that we have to watch O
Brother Where Art Thou again, after he misquoted it the other day, which
is unacceptable. After watching the movie, I just chilled around the
house basically until going to Jack's for yet another bonfire. A lot
different though, there were a ton of people and most of them were
camping Jack's back yard for the night haha. Pretty nice that I live
walking distance...and so that was fun, Zdanowski couldn't stay, again,
cuz he had to get up for baseball, again, but like everybody was there
so it was cool. Pretty glad I wasn't going to be sleeping like 12 people
to that 6 man tent!</p>
<h4>Today</h4>
<p>Well, I just work up about an hour ago and sat down to eat some cereal,
but am instead sharing my thought to the world. Del wants to play
tennis, which is pretty random, but I think I'm gonna go for a ride if I
ever get around to it. It sucks that I don't know anybody else my age
around here who rides...the only person I can think of is Tommy Forte
but I don't really know him. Frickin Shields had to blow out his knee so
that he doesn't want to bike anymore and save what strength his knee
does have for water skiing, which I guess I can't blame him for but I
need somebody to ride with! Other than that I got no plans, maybe I'll
beef up my blog some more later haha. Or I could look into making a
comment bar....but it's not like anybody reads this. I was going to use
google analytics and their tracking cookies so that I could see how many
people come to my site and what pages they visit and for how long, but I
think I would just be disappointed lol cuz I wouldn't have any data to
work with cuz nobody visits! Maybe they do, who knows, so don't block my
cookies!</p>
