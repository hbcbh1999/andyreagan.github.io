    <p>So first off, I don't have a whole lot (any) free time this year
basically at college. So the fate of this journal this fall may
be...grim. But I think that I can find the time to do once a month at
least. The thing is, as I update this at night...I would be sleeping,
and that's the one thing I don't get enough of!</p>
<p>Since the 13th...I basically got ready to come down to Tech, hung out
with my friends for the last few times, drove down with Kyle, and have
spent the past week getting re-acquainted with the college friends! I
also had my first day of classes today and missed one (I didn't go to
Physics recessitation because I assumed that we wouldn't be having it
since we hadn't had the lecture yet, but was wrong...although as it
turns out, my roommate Rob is in the class and I didn't miss anything.)
and I was almost late to another, but it went well. I only had 3 classes
today, the real fun starts
tomorrow.Â <a href="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/areagan/oldsite/blogs/files/schedule_fall09.pdf">This</a>
is a copy of that schedule...</p>
<p>That's it for now. For more updates follow my twitter haha...and you
don't actually have to sign up for an account, just click the link on
top called "More" and wait for it to load!</p>
